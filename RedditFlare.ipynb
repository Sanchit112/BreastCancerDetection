Additional to that, reach out to organisations working locally in your area and like someone said above, try and fill the gap in a disrupted supply chain. I’m not sure working for NGOs right now would get you any money. It’s going to be volunteer work only. However you can try and write to Centre For Internet & Society , explaining your situation and see if they can give you any paid work that you can do remotely. All the Best ! Really hope something works out for you. \\n\\nP.S you can reach out to this NGO called Milaap , if you need help with some groceries and food. They would be happy to help you, they also run crowdfunding campaigns so if it’s really hard for you to find employment right now , I’m sure they’ll be able to help you in some way.

Prarambhik Shishak Kosh, MNREGA fund\\n6. Provident fund, Postal insurance etc. and so on\\nNo permission from parliament to government is required for spending from this account.\\n\\nConsolidated Fund of India:\\nAll the cash from direct and indirect taxes, all the loans that are taken by the government of India and money returned as principal or interest of the loans given by the government. This is the largest of all three funds. The government needs parliament\\'s approval to spend money from this fund\\n> The amount of money we pay as our taxes... They use it to gain goodwill for their parties(state or center) by freeing loans, water, electricity, transport and even their election campaigns. So in the time of actual needs, they dont have enough funds to fight the crisis. The Govt of India (central Govt.) runs a fiscal deficit every year. This means that they spend more money than the revenue they raise. Note that this deficit needs to be financed which incurs additional costs.\\n\\nThe GoI doesn\\'t earn much money because there is rampant tax evasion due to a multitude of factors. India has a large unorganised \"off the books\" sector which doesn\\'t pay taxes, the Indian state doesn\\'t have the capacity to go after all tax evaders and prosecute them, etc. This results in the only reliable revenue streams for the Govt being salaried tax payers, GST collected and some other taxes. From this, GST payments have been less than projected because the Govt vastly overestimated the broadening of the tax base post-GST.\\n\\nNow, a large chunk of the Govt.\\'s expenditure goes into schemes for the \"upliftment of the poor\" and \"rural development\", etc etc. The problem with this is that the state controls the disbursement of these funds and uses them to serve itself. By the \\'state\\' I mean people who are a part of the state, ie: politicians and bureaucrats.\\n\\nSo taxpayer money is used for crony capitalism, to gain favour with the electorate so they\\'re elected again, etc. A lot of this money also flows out of the system through corruption. Bureaucrats tasked with building 10 toilets might only build 2 and pocket the funds allocated for the other 8.\\n\\nThis is how taxpayer money in India is only used to serve politicians\\' and bureaucrats\\' interests and neither does the honest taxpayer see any return on their taxes and neither is any section of the society \\'uplifted\\'.\\n\\nThere is no accountability and no transparency. potholed roads, slow public transport, namesake education and healthcare It\\'s not a begging bowl. It\\'s a psychological tactic, they know you\\'ll donate when the country is going through a crisis \"even when we have enough money to handle the crisis\" and some stupid other projects which are approved during this crisis in past few weeks. \\n>The fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?\\n\\n\\nBecause generations of people before you decided a spine is an unneccesary thing that doesnt befit our Indian culture. Now,those with spines exploit,and everyone spineless suffers. Blame the populace.thats where all the govt employees come from. Because if they have to give out from the government\\'s kitty, it means less money for politicians and their cronies to loot. India is poor - its a banal and boring answer but it is still true.\\n\\nIndia needs just insane amounts of money to build its infrastructure to first world levels.\\n\\nIndia needs large amounts of time to build its human infrastructure (non corrupt officers, people used to following the law - the habits of civilization)\\n\\nOur tax income isn\\'t superb. Our usage of money isn\\'t super - we leak all over the place.\\n\\nThis means the government will always benefit from extra financial support during a crisis.\\n\\nIt also gives people a way to help - which is what most civilized people do. They feel bad when they see someone in trouble, and want to help, This is one way to do so.

Work and enjoy in your own ways when you are healthy. Go see the world. Then move to an assisted living apartments when you are retired from working. Don\\'t wait to become a cabbage to move to such living. Make friends there and plan for becoming a cabbage phase of life there. I think you are missing the point of marriage. \\n\\nIt’s less to do with spousal/children support as you grow old, and more to do with going through life with fulfilling relationships. As a 65 year old, let me say that raising my daughter was about the most elevating and fulfilling experiences I have had in my life. It has completed me. She is now 30plus, doing her own thing, in another country, and I certainly don’t expect her to come and stay and look after me when I am old and infirm. And I cannot but keep thanking her for being born as my daughter. \\n\\nMy wife is my age, and we have now started the journey of looking after one another. When she was ill, I stayed by her side, and when I suffered a heart attack recently, she stayed by mine. And we keep fussing over each other. It’s called growing old together. \\n\\nBut yes, I did plan financially for my older years, and those plans have more or less come to fruition. But that’s just a bonus. The main part of my life and marriage has been the fulfilling relationships, although I will admit the journey was fraught with severe issues and problems. But when you put everything on a scale, I would gladly go through all this again and again. \\n\\nSo don’t look at marriage as a prop for your old age. That’s silly. Look at it as a journey of fulfilment of relationships,  and going through the joys, the trials and the tribulations of parenthood. I am 31 and single. The point of marriage is not to find a woman who\\'ll replace my mother. If that is the need then I\\'ll get a nurse in old age or go to an old age home. \\n\\nUnless I don\\'t find a partner who has a similar mindset, has a personality of her own, is equally ambitious and will carry on in future even if I am not around, there is no point in saying yes to a random woman just for the sake of someone being there when I am old. \\n\\nI have seen couples who got married at 26 and have spent 4-5 years just quarreling and arguing on pety topics. People who didn\\'t get a chance to understand each other before marriage and are now regretting. I don\\'t want to live in such a marriage. \\n\\nMy parents forced me into engineering and after two years I realised that this place is not for me. The argument that my parents used to send me to this Engg College was that it will give you a well settled lifestyle and secure future. After a year I was suicidal. Now if I get married because it is a guarantee to secure old age and not because I really like the girl (and she likes me back) then chances are that I (or both of us) will end up in a similar situation and I won\\'t get an option like dropping out of this course without thinking of some serious repercussions. Am 37 and unmarried. I think my only fear is medical emergencies. \\n\\nRest all can be managed Its crazy to me how many people in India look at marriage and kids as an \"investment for the future\" rather than the personal relationship they are supposed to be at the present. Guess that\\'s why arranged marriages and the pressure to marry is so common. Its not so much a natural alignment of 2 people sharing their lives and more like a cold business transaction? Its quite strange. Hmm.. a lot of people have expressed their opinions.. as of me, I’m almost in the same boat as you.. my suggestion is to start saving and invest in PPF, FD & KVP. Eat healthy and exercise.. when you’re old and single, go to a old age home.. [deleted] > not so much about loneliness\\n\\nLet me ask you a question. Do you feel lonely now? Do you have friends to hang out with frequently now? Or someone really close to you?\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to answer that here. That\\'s for yourself.\\n\\nThe point is people get married because it gets lonely after a while. Now I\\'m only 28 but I know for a fact that I can\\'t live alone. If I could have a partner and not get married that\\'s fine too. But people need stability, legal benefits and financial benefits. So most people prefer a marriage. Not to mention that it has a social meaning to it.\\n\\n> But I sometime wonder what will happen to me?\\n\\nIt\\'s funny how you feel this already and yet thought of not getting married. The point of marriage is companionship. Kids taking care of parents is such an old concept. Let the kids live free. It\\'s only the parents responsibility to groom them, guide them and let them find their way. You do that out of love not out of obligation.\\n\\nAnd if you don\\'t want that responsibility, don\\'t have kids!\\n\\nYou and your partner will take care of each other. And you have to plan for the worst case anyway in case you become all alone.\\n\\nHope you find your way. I plan to never get married. There are several reasons for it, failed marriage of my parents is one of them, but i just don’t know how to convince my parents. Following are the challenges.\\n\\n1) my mom always tell me what will society think, like am i gay or something. No i am not but if I don’t get married my parents will get embarrassed by this things\\n\\n2) my parents said i will feel very alone and will get depressed when i will come home and there will be no one to welcome me. (Like i am not already depressed haha)\\n\\n3) our society just treats single men as a threat.

Please bear with me. Also using a throwaway account for privacy concerns.\\n\\n\\nThis morning I woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. The landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. The landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so I was surprised to hear him shouting.The argument was pretty one-sided though. So, I wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. \\n\\nShe says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. She says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet.\\nShe says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs.\\n\\nA little background about my family:\\nWe're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. Things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. They were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. My mother, a teacher, was also the earning member.\\nAt this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and I'm 7 years old. My father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. A few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. \\nMy father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. She teaches Yoga as a home tutor. My mother handled things for a few years. Fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. It has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. I was aware of this and I was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and I graduated a year later with a job in my hand. The job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which I'll be considered an employee of the company. \\n\\nCut to the question:\\nI was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, I never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and I happened to be awake at that time.\\n\\nI really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. My mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally. My dad is already very depressed (but he pretends he isn't) and also on the brink of his retirement age.I have a job now, and I'll be on the company payrolls as an employee from September.\\n\\nI don't want my mother to struggle anymore, what can I do, as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can I have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it.\", 1586956748.0, 'AskIndia', \"One thing I will say is don't try to clear off the loans by taking a loan on the basis of your job. At this point in time, you should breach the subject slowly and talk about what expenses your family has. Things that you can take care of once you start working. Once you have a fair idea of the expenses, you can plan your next move to settle the debts. This will honestly need a very hard talk with your parents but it has to be done now.\\n\\nAnd since it's a lockdown currently, you could help your father out by asking him what his work experience is like and if possible, help him find a job. Today's job market is very different from their time. It's going virtual and there's no one better than you to help your father learn. He sounds like he has plenty of experience and there a few companies that hire people as consultants on projects. For those reaching retirement age, consultancy is one of the best ways to stay productive. Your parents have shielded you from all the storms around them and because of that you are now an adult who's ready to fend for the family. Kudos to them! They need all the appreciation and support you can give them. Depending on how much you'll be earning, set out a plan to clear off the debts. Also liquidate any assets if possible to bring down liability. You already have a job in hand, so you're good. Just look after your parents and keep them free from any more tensions. Good luck! Debt- 10 lakhs.. damn I feel you coz I was in a similar position when I had to leave college.. my recovery process to pay off my debt (also in lakhs) was that I had to work abroad for a few years.. in places like Dubai and Singapore they pay really well.. I am not suggesting you to dive there as you are a engineer and you have a job in India.. my suggestion stick to your job and minimise expenses and save.. if your company can give you a loan it can be great.. other senior members please advise.. Your parents are amazing, and your mum has the patience of a saint and I really do admire her the resilience.\\n\\nBe VERY smart with your money when you move to the new city for your job- try to do everything you can in order to save money i.e. clean, cook yourself instead of hiring someone, etc. Always spend your money in this order: your non-variables (rent, electricity), loans, grocery, savings, and then use the leftover money for miscellaneous activities/ items. Take your job seriously and work smart+hard. \\n\\nGood luck :) Upvoting this. Financially smart guys, please help OP with your ideas to help this family tide over the crisis. I was also in your position 6 years back. We are a small family of me and my mom. She single handedly paid for my education till 12th class. The job took toll on her health and could not continue doing same. So she resigned to her job in my BTech 1st year.  BTech education cost was handled by government as part of a scheme.\\n\\nSo, my mom started a business of running a fancy items shop. We had that shop running for 3 years. In these 3 years, I understood the reality of debts we had. We were unable to pay the electricity bill few times and electricity dept cut the power to our house few times as well. We used to run behind the rent payments as well. But the landlord was understanding and did not make any issues out of it.\\n\\nThere came a time, when financers used to come to our house at odd times and demand money at very odd times in rude manner, knowing that business is not doing well.\\n\\nSo, we have had around 5 lakhs debt with very high intrest from multiple financers. So I took the first job that is offered to me and as soon as I completed probation, first thing that I did was took a personal loan and cleared all of the debts in around 4 years.\\n\\nSo, what am I saying is, whatever the situation you are in, it's not impossible to overcome. You will go through it and emerge as a better person.\\n\\n1. Try consolidating your debts - find out what is the interest rate you are paying to current debtors. See if you can get a loan for smaller intrest rate than that.\\n2.  First, you complete your probation or whatever the period you mentioned, before actually going for applying for loans.\\n3. You budget Your salary accordingly and see what percent of your salary, you would be able to spend as EMI.\\n4. Speak with your family members and see if you can get any help. Say for example, if your mom and dad could do any part time jobs to help handle any of the expenses,so that you could use that money from ur salary, which you could use to pay off debts.\\n5. If you take any loans from any bank, make sure to pay off the emis without any failures. \\n6. Try googling debt consolidation. I am sure you will find many articles which u might find useful. respect for your parents. one thing i would say is make sure your father is occupied with something especially as he is depressed as i know many unemployed dad's waste money on drinking , gambling and other useless stuff. health should be your top priority, financial situation improves with time. when i was born dad didn't have enough money to buy a gas cylinder at home, today he saved enough to send me abroad for masters. OP check out /r/personalfinance , /r/FIREIndia , /r/IndiaInvestments . You need to take stock of the situation and take your next steps accordingly. You are dealing with debt, and there are many posts in the sub-reddits that advise on how to manage and pay off debt. You will be able to devise a plan, and also know that you are not alone. Reading some of those posts will help you realise that your issue is not insurmountable. So keep the faith!\\n\\nI commend you for wanting to help your parents. With regards to the hand loans from relatives, find out the details like sums borrowed and terms of the loans. Discussions with them will be tough. Hopefully, they are able to be open and honest with you on details, and you guys can figure out how to band together. Figure out your current assets too. It really sucks, but it helps to take the emotion out of it, and approach the problem practically.\\n\\nIt is an uphill struggle but if you are disciplined with your finances and put a plan in place, you will start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Is it only me who thinks his parents should have been honest with him. I can understand not sharing all this till graduation but after graduation, they should treat him like an adult and explain the real deal instead of OP finding it out from the landlords fight. I have been in similar situation. I think you should follow below steps:\\n1. Try to find out all the open loans they have including rate of interest per loan.\\n2. Try to negotiate higher interest rate to lower one. \\n3. In cases, where there is no interest, request payment date after 2-3 years \\n4. For the highest interest loan, please take a private loan from bank and see if that is cheaper. \\n5. Try to see if you can use your house as mortgage and get additional loan\\n6. Keep a strict budget control and continue to pay people regularly.\\n7. If all goes good, you should be debt free in 2-3 years. \\n\\nI hope this helps.\"], ['What is the PM CARES fund being used for? how can one know and track its flow? Is it a transparent system?

I feel like quality of life is way better in 1st world countries. I think people in India can have a good quality life but they put too many responsibilities on themselves , especially having more than one child. To answer your question most people who had a taste of living in 1st world countries will prefer to stay in those countries. That should tell you something about living outside India. This is my opinion , I like India as much as the next guy, I don’t mean to offend anyone. I live in Europe and would like to come back to India. But, the same thing can't be said about my wife. Unfortunately, women face lot of challenges in India - relatives and society in general are too intrusive in a woman's life. They get told how they should behave a lot.

Not to mention the travel.\\n\\nI live in a city where I have access to good infrastructure in terms of healthcare, malls, food etc. Nothing to complain here too.\\n\\nMy whole cost of living right now as described above for me and my wife does not exceed 50,000 a month on most months. And we don't compromise on anything. Thankfully neither of us has any interest in fancy cars or jewelry or stupidly costly phones.\\n\\nLiving abroad access to all of this would be much more expensive.\\n\\nBesides the above, the only other material thing I want is to be able to travel to a nice place 2 times a year. That's also not super expensive for me. Traveling more than that gets boring.\\n\\nI don't want any more material things than this.

Sell something of value to people, and I will max out my ambitions before I reach even 2% of the market.\\n\\nAbout politics and religion etc: Does not affect me. Religion wise I am atheistic and if somebody shows up at my door and wants me to convert, I'll do it in a heartbeat. I don't have a lot of respect for my default religion so why not change it.\\n\\nAs for politics, I think it's a complex game. So, I don't have strong feeling about how this is right and that is wrong.

Only feel at home here where I know the language and look like the people.\\n\\nSo, lots of reasons to stay for me at least.\\n\\nMaybe others are no lucky and face different challenges.

The healthcare is amazing, the government actually cares about its people, the people are very welcoming. \\n\\nThe work culture is really good, no one works more than they are suppose to. There is no obligation of working more than whats assigned. Leaves are earned not begged for.\\n\\nMy wife has been extremely happy here, there is not a single week where she does not mention that she cant believe she wasted so much of her life stuck in India. Given the current situation and political landscape, i do not think WE would be moving back anytime soon. I would leave the first chance I get no questions asked. Money was not the reason I left. However, some the major reasons that pushed me to leave (conservative society, lack of freedom, lots of sexual harrasment) might probably not have been an issue if I was super rich and lived among other wealthy people.\\n\\nAlso, I always had the itch to travel and explore different cultures. At 21, fresh out of college and coming from a middle class family, studying abroad was the only way I could live in another country. \\n\\nIf money were no bar, I would probably keep traveling and living in different countries while also spending lots of time in India with family.

Please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with American ideas. In many Indian communities, dating is now common in the younger generation, but telling your family about a significant other = an engagement. So in an Indian context, for many people, its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement.  \\nIf your relationship is strong in every other way, a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part.

Many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process. \\n\\nPerhaps one way to proceed is to get on her team, become her partner and ally in negotiating between cultures. After all, once you marry an Indian, you\\'ve joined the wild and subtle dance of inhabiting multiple cultures for life, my friend.  So ask questions, something like:\\n\\n- What does your family think about X?\\n- What can we do to set them at ease about X?\\n- How can we communicate to them that XYZ is important to me/us?\\n- What is important to them / what are their concerns about X?\\n\\nGet yourselves on the same team, so that you\\'re not another node in the cultural tug-of-war. \\n\\nOnce more, every person and every relationship is unique, and so is every family, so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt. Dude. I’m an Indian girl engaged to a non indian, and half my family still doesn’t know. Trust me, it’s less drama this way. Ask her if her mom is against the extended family knowing. How does she plan to break the news of the marriage to them? How old are you both? I\\'m from Coimbatore and it\\'s still a very conservative place compared to other big cities. Her reservations about revealing about you to her family could be because of two reasons. Most families here are not very encouraging of love marriages and doubly so when it\\'s interracial. She may be holding off because she doesn\\'t want the extended family making unwanted remarks about her relationship. It is not unusual for the family to reveal to others in the extended family about the relationship only after the wedding dates are set. In a conservative South Indian set up there\\'s only courting no dating. \\n\\nAlso she may not be very sure of what the future holds especially since you guys may end up living in different cities. And if it doesn\\'t work out, if she has to get an arranged marriage then if her extended family knows about a prior relationship with an American her value in the arranged marriage market goes down. You need to ask yourself this first. Is it really necessary for you to want her extended family to know about you?\\nOver here in some conservative communities , extended family will poke their huge noses in EVERY matter. I\\'m not exaggerating by any means. It is a nuisance . Imagine them calling you everyday and asking why you don\\'t have kids and then making fun of you for not being a \"man\" and earning more than his wife. They will berate you . Your partner is aware of that and is trying to tread carefully here . So understand her side, know that this is a serious situation and give her time to deal with this . Also take some time to brush up on her family politics lol A lot of Indian families are very close knit, children (even after 18) are close with their parents and often support them financially too. Parents too support their children, emotionally and financially.\\n\\nHere are a few things you need to consider.\\n- Find out how close is she to her family\\n- How orthodox is her family, immediate most importantly.\\n\\nIf she\\'s really close and is from an orthodox family, you\\'re definitely in for trouble. Reason being it\\'s quite likely they would want an arrangement within the faith and even possibly the same language. That being said, if she\\'s not really close she may still be okay going against their wishes. But if she is really close, 99% chance she will not go against their wishes. Though you\\'ve probably been told this, marrying someone from another country, heck, even just a slightly different community then your own is a HUGE deal in India. Having a job and being independent would give her more standing and give her decisions (like deciding to marry you) more weight and respect in the community. My cousin was dating his gf for about 6 years (who was also from India but from a different state) before he told his parents because he was waiting to get a good job. When I told my parents about my girlfriend who was Indian but was Christian, there were fights and tears for several months and my own mother couldn\\'t talk to me for an entire month. This despite the fact that we\\'re comparatively a very progressive family, with several relatives including myself living abroad. And all this is exponentially harder for a girl because India is still quite patriarchal and women asserting their independence can cause major freakouts. \\n\\nSo please realise that this isn\\'t about YOU. You don\\'t have to convince her of anything or explain to her how important it is to you etc etc. She already knows all these things. And she agrees with all these things. She is on your side. However, the careful manoeuvres required to inform parents and extended family... Leave those decisions to her. She has taken the first steps which is telling her sister and her mother. My guess is her mother is still getting acclimatized to the idea. And before she tells her father she would need her mother\\'s support. If mother\\'s support is there, even if her father gets upset she (your gf) will have someone on the inside (her mom) to placate him. Otherwise things could get ugly fast. \\n\\nAgain it\\'s not about you at all. It\\'s unfortunate that Indian families are like this. But these tight family bonds lead to a much more supportive, connected and loving family structure once all this blows over and you won\\'t regret it. It\\'s just that some people are old fashioned and need some time to come to terms with big changes. All their life her parents probably had ideas on what her wedding would be like or what kind of groom they will find for her and they have to suddenly make a 180 on the things they\\'ve simply believed all their lives.\\n\\nSimilar issues will arise when her parents want to tell the rest of the family. There are a lot of things they will consider. Things like timing and maybe first slowly introducing the idea that she\\'s dating someone without revealing who it is. They may also want to go in person to have this discussion. In the case in my family each move was very carefully planned and we aren\\'t even particularly close or dependant on the extended family. \\n\\nIf you want to make things easier for her, make some efforts to understand her culture. Learn a bit of the language, buy some traditional Indian clothes (with her help!). Read up on Indian history so you better understand the context of some things. And make sure to support her when she starts facing push back (which she 100% will) from her family and extended family. People may say awful things about her to her face, stuff that makes her cry. Your job is NOT to get angry at that moment or say something like \"fuck those guys how dare they say that\" and try and break away from the family. Instead be patient and give it time, lots of time. Be like a river that carves its way through a canyon. Just with patience and time you can win over even the most conservative folks in her family. But she has to be the one taking these decisions on how to move the needle forward. Just trust her and wait. About the job thing, there isn\\'t anything extra you can do. She knows it\\'s important too, but far more important things are on the line, lifelong family relationships and she definitely has to prioritize that. If she messes it up, both the job and the relationships get fucked. She must be smart enough to know that this stuff is time sensitive, she\\'s struggling with these decisions as well. I can\\'t imagine there is anything you can tell her she hasn\\'t thought of already. You are asking relationship advice on a forum where 99% of the population have never had contact with the opposite sex. Have patience, wait a while. Get the \"job\" after graduation and everything will sail through smoothly. They won\\'t budge an eye when they see how well-established their girl is with you, emotionally and of course Financially. You need to ask her about why she is against the extended family knowing about both of you. You need her to give you an honest answer. And you need to really really understand whether the answer is honest'], ['She is leaving me because of me being poor what should I do?', 119, 'fx29yh', Subreddit(display_name='india'), 'https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx29yh/she_is_leaving_me_because_of_me_being_poor_what/', 179, \"Sorry for poor formatting I am on phone.\\n\\n\\nWe(M22|F25) are in relationship from past three year.\\nWe both have already planned for marriage after being in relationship for 1 year .\\n\\n\\n\\nWe also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nThings are going not as I supposed to go .\\n\\n\\nNow she have changed her mind completely.\\n\\n\\nA brief background about her - She have a poverty based childhood and she have worked part time throughout her life to afford her family needs and her father was nothing less than a person just existing,never supported her and her mother.\\n\\n\\nEven now she and her mother supports the family.\\n\\n\\nNo one respects her family as they are poor.\\n\\n\\nShe feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering Indian society mentality.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow she refuse to Marry me saying she would marry someone richer as I am also not in very good financial condition though I have a job in computer science field and I need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.\\n\\n\\nShe wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in Indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.\\nShe wants to rest and enjoy her life.\\n\\n\\nShe said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.\\n\\n\\nShe can decide whom to marry or not and I can't put pressure on her to marry me.\\n\\n\\nShe also told me that she don't want to be part of me when I am struggling.\\n\\n\\nShe will marry me only if I get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both EMI and lifestyle)\\n\\n\\nIf she decides to marry me she have to work maybe for one year which she clearly said no that she don't want to marry me as if things don't workout the way we think then she will end up cursing me for snatching her opportunity of marrying someone richer.\\n\\nI asked her that I will try my best to give her best life but I need one year of support from her so that I can buy a house on EMI but she ends up breaking up.\\n\\nWhat should I do ?\", 1586361105.0, 'AskIndia', \"She was your Half Girlfriend.

Those we are taught to respect also think that is okay for them to beat us *on the pretext of disciplining us*. For example, parents think that it is okay to beat their children, teachers -> students, police -> citizens, politicians -> govt workers(i.e. police and others). Sometimes, with children, it even transcends immediate family, and siblings of parents also beat the children.\\n\\nI think that it should be taught that respect goes both ways. Students respect teachers, and converse *must* also be true. In simple terms, every person must respect others regardless of their age, relationship, profession, etc. One doesn't need fancy words, while talking with kids, to show that they respect them, because, just the tone of their speech can.\\n\\nAs I learnt from reddit, *Be excellent to each other*.

A lot of my 22 years of existence has been spent with criticism over every little thing and huge amounts of comparison. I don\\'t know why parents think comparing what you do to someone else is a good thing. I get that they mean well but I personally feel it\\'s damaging. At least it has been for me, as I\\'ve never felt confident about anything I do and it\\'s brought up various struggles I\\'m still dealing with. There are good moments ofcourse, but sometimes it feels like the bad ones outweigh the good ones. This is something where I\\'m extremely fortunate. We talk about EVERYTHING. Relationships, politics, movies, problems I\\'m facing, alcohol etc. etc. I do feel that their expectations are high but that\\'s only because they believe that I can make something of my life. As a result/ side effect of this closeness I literally cannot lie to my parents, so maybe that\\'s a downside lol. I love my Dad, but my mother is a real bummer all the time. Picking fights over nothing and shouting about minute things Non-existent It\\'s good now, but only if a lot of things are left unsaid. My mom used to beat me when I was a kid, but we dont talk about it anymore. I also tried coming out to her once but she told me to shut up and \"go study\" lol. But I still respect her and my dad for everything they\\'ve done for me. It\\'s a weird/awkward place to be in lol Love my parents. But the news is driving a wedge. Never thought the same parents who I always knew as compassionate and logical are falling for all sorts of fake news. Adding a comment because I hope this gets traction. \\n\\nHad an okay relationship with my mom and a shit relationship with dad until I was 20. Dad and I have been non contact for years at a time since the age of 13. \\n\\nAt 20, full extent of mom\\'s infidelity came out, and what hurt most was how much she used me especially (I have an elder sister and a younger brother) to help carry out her extra marital affairs (close to 9 different partners over several years). \\n\\nAnyway, after this I left home with my ex and just went full no contact with the whole family for a few years. Ex dumped me in the middle of nowhere. I was a wreck and had to be institutionalised. Dad cried. And I mean cried. It was when I realised how much love my father had for me but never knew how to show it. \\n\\nAnyway, years have passed, I\\'m now happily married. Mom and I are civil but I don\\'t think I will ever forgive her for everything she did. She, my sister and brother have somehow managed to move on. I don\\'t know how they do it. It\\'s a very superficial relationship. She tries but I don\\'t have it in me to deal with everything. \\n\\n\\nDad. Dad is something else. He used to be this ultra conservative tough man and is now the picture of gentleness. \\n\\nI think Indian parents have a lot of \"growing up\" to do. The previous generation ruined them. On my mom\\'s side there is not so subtle racism, adultery and elitist behaviour. She was raised a terrible way. Dad\\'s side bore grudges for years. My paternal grandma hadn\\'t spoken to my late grandfather for close to 20 years before he passed. Dad also inherited those traits. \\n\\nHowever it takes a lot of patience from the kids and tough love to change and mould our parents the way they do us. At least that\\'s what my anecdotal evidence would have me believe. My parents are much much better people than they were in their youth. Maybe separating has done them a lot of good. But I also know for a fact, that we kids also had a lot to do with their growth.\\n\\nEdit: sorry on rereading my comment I realise it\\'s quite harried and full of grammatical errors.

There is lot I want to say and again, I don\\'t want to say anything because of the feeling of being indebted to them.\\n\\nI\\'ve been told time and time again that what parents do for their kids is their duty and there shouldn\\'t be a feeling of indebtment about that, but somehow, having seen my families troubles over my life, I can\\'t shake that feeling away.\\n\\nI had a weird relationship with my parents. They could never accept that I was good at anything. Perhaps they were afraid that if they say I did good, I\\'d become complacent. That\\'s why when I stood first in all exams from class 5 to 10 and even topped my school in board, all I heard from my father was that it was not me who was good but the rest that were so bad that I was coming first. In the same vain, if I scored 90 marks I was told to focus on the 10 that I didn\\'t get and not on the 90 I got.\\n\\nMy mom was only concerned about keeping me away from girls, so I studied in a boy\\'s school. Whenever I had a chance to come in contact with opposite sex, I was scolded and taught how this is not their values.\\n\\nThe came the eventual letting down moment where I fell for a girl (who was older and likely only taking advantage of me), and I was essentially disowned by my father who labelled me with a disappointment to him.\\n\\nEven after all this I married for love and even though none of my parents approved, they agreed to it since I was already a disappointment and nothing could be done. My wife still faces racist remarks about her color, caste (she is of a higher caste), etc.\\n\\nBut she is the most amazing woman who actually worked hard to bring me closer to my family.\\n\\nTwist: Even she has given up now but I am a closer to them than I was a few years ago. Well, there’s a big generational gap between me and my parents, My father has a soft spot for bjp (he isn’t a hardcore supporter but respects Modi) and mom is indifferent to politics, both of them would be moderately religious while I’m irreligious atheist, liberal and kinda hippie with shoulder length hair. They’ve always seen me as a rebellious child who never listens to anyone, when I started growing my hair out back when I was 17, they constantly bagged me cut it, then after a year or so, they stopped caring about my hair, I’m also planning to get tattoos and piercings done after college, so they’ve probably realised by now that we’ve a huge generational gap and our beliefs lie on the opposite end of spectrum. \\n\\nOne thing I like about them is they’re less religious than, what I believe, average Indians are, there’s no everyday evening prayers or nuisance rituals that I’d be forced participate, they just bow before and put flowers on idols once a day and that’s it. My parents are also well aware of my irreligiousness, which is good.\\n\\nAs for my opinion, I believe they’re doing their job pretty good, they pay my fees and nagged me to study back when I was in school. What I don’t like is how they were opposed to recreational entertainment when I was in primary school, whenever I turn-on the TV or computer to play games they’d constantly nagged me to stop wasting time, like how much do they expect a primary school student to study, 12 hours?\\n\\nI do believe that most Indians suffer from some form of Stockholm syndrome where their parents abuse them mentally or physically and their kids love their parents to death. Indians put their parents on pedestal next to god, which is likely because of our toxic culture habits of obeying and respecting elders even if they don’t deserve.'], ['How much money should an average Indian youth spend on a smartphone?', 43, 'g358tp', Subreddit(display_name='india'), 'https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g358tp/how_much_money_should_an_average_indian_youth/', 59, 'I am an average Indian youth.

But unfortunately I have lost interest in engineering completely. I didn't do any hardwork  and I never took my studies seriously. But now I have even stopped trying. I'm afraid of carrying too many backlogs. I'm in 4th sem now and already carrying 8 backlog subjects. But in semester I didn't even went to college. I don't know anything.\\n\\nMy family is typical middle class. My father and mother had very high hopes on me. But I disappointed them. But over the years my relation with my family is getting wider. I didn't attend a single festival in my home. I missed Diwali, Dashara, Holi everything.

But since I got more than 95% in state board exams in 10th my family didn't allow me to take arts. I'm kind of a guy who always loved history, economics, geography and everything but I was not serious about my life that time. But the thing is my father is afraid of our fucking society and there remarks. I know he will kill me if I told him that I want to drop my course. Guys please any suggestions are welcomed. Thank you for reading :|\", 1586916545.0, 'AskIndia', \"What after BA? Answer depends on that. It shouldn't be just an escape route from a difficult stream of education. You're already in 4th Sem too and everyone at some point feel they want to drop out of something. It isn't always a wise choice. I dropped from engineering in 2011. I didn't tell my parents for almost 2 years. They only found out about it when my college called them and said that I have 0% attendance. \\n\\nBut my advice is don't do this. Your parents will freak out and unless you have a source of income, this won't work. \\n\\nYou can do a couple of things.\\n\\n1. Find a job. BPOs will hire you if you have good professional and communication skills. You can also try your luck in content writing if you know the basics. One of my friends dropped out of IIT and started working as a software engineer. Once she started earning, parents accepted her choice. Same thing happened with me. Once I started earning and got published in a few travel magazines, my parents were alright if this is what you want to do then do. \\n\\n2. If you have an elder sibling, put a word in their mind. Younger ones help but most of the times it doesn't have that impact of a older brother/sister. \\n\\n3. See a therapist. They'll conclude that most of your problems in your life is because of Engineering. Show this diagnosis to your parents\\n\\n4. Come clean to your parents that you hate engineering. Depends on how rigid your parents are, expect a lot of quarrels and arguments. Eventually they'll give up (remember to cry a little) \\n\\n5. Pack your bags, go home, tell them that you can't return. Don't. \\nAt 19, you would not be in a position to understand how important a degree is.\\nEngineering degree does carry a weight.\\n\\nNothing stops you from focussing your subjects for eg. History while you finish your engineering.\\nA lot of engg. Grads work in diverse fields after their degree from call centers, to media, govt, etc.\\n\\nThe point is it is natural to get these thoughts but do not give up.\\n\\nBacklogs are there as you have let them to be there. \\nEducation is your best bet to move up from middle class. \\n\\nIn short, dad's right. Finish your degree. Don't be a pussy. dude.  i feel like im in a time machine here. I'm 38. Like every freaking line in your post resonates with me. didnt like engineering. took a break for 4 months. End of 4th sem. Didnt attend college much. middle class family. wanted to do BA. Top marks in school. Interest in the arts. never attended festivals or socialized. top college. every freaking thing you mentioned.\\n\\nI dropped for few months, major shitstorm it was. but i went back ultimately as no college was taking a guy with a 2 yrs break from high school. My engineering GP was screwed. Passed out of it though.\\n\\nI now work in software and exceptionally good at, lived half my career abroad, earned very well in life and giving my kids the upbringing I never had. Here's what I learnt.\\n\\n\\\\-Arts career doesnt do shit in India unless you are like in the top 5-10% in your field and have family wealth\\n\\n\\\\-There are tons of dumb guys in engineering with like 20% of your ability and earn very well. They will end up having a better life than you. \\n\\n\\\\-There will be tons of dumb guys in arts stream as well and only a few with passion and work ethic. You will be badly disappointed later if you follow through with your wish.\\n\\n\\\\-Thing is that wherever you go in India, whatever stream or discipline, 80% will be morons just for survival. No one follows anything out of passion or a sense of calling. If you are passionate enough to score 95%, just put that in engineering and get a safety net and ensure a good comfortable life for yourself first.\\n\\n\\\\-Late teens is a difficult stage in life. You just want to live in your own world away from the irritating annoying aunties and uncles, neighbours and relatives and their shitty expectations about you. Just get a thick skin and ignore it. Set a goal to be academically top and go after it. Hard work is something that you have to do all your life whether your a Topper or a Bottomranker. You will definitely feel proud of yourself rest of your life if you can clear your backlogs and do well in your last 8 sems.\\n\\n\\\\-Finally you have been born in the wrong country to do something like this. Our big cities are ruthless and have no places for dreamers and creative people. Our systems are a failure. Only we can fend for ourselves. Just pull on and graduate.\\n\\n\\\\-Another thing - do you have any other issues in life? are the professors idiotic or the college has moronic rules? Thats any drawback in a bad education system. I actually now get exposed to the best teachers of every stream of engineering(EEE, Mech, Thermal, CSE) and spend hours watching youtube videos, even buy textbooks and solve problems. Please put up with it for now, until you see some really passionate people in Engineering itself(Check out Richard Buckland videos on youtube, he is an awesome CS teacher).\\n\\nFinal word: finish your degree, set a goal for the next 3 months to give 100% irrespective of results and see what it goes. And PM me if you want to talk further. I HAVE SOME CRITICAL WORK TODAY, saw this on my mobile, logged in to my laptop and created an account just to write this post as I was reminded of myself. [deleted] Don't drop the course. Finish your engineering degree. Tighten your belt, work as hard as you can even if you hate it, get your degree done. You can evaluate your options after that.\\n\\nYou have your whole life ahead of you. You can read history/eco/geog in your spare time for now... Do not drop out man.. Fortunately, an Engineering degree still has a lot of value in India compared to other degrees. So whatever you want after getting that degree.\\n\\nDon't waste the two years you've invested in it. Hey, not an advise but sharing some life experience here. My cousin was in the same situation as you. He opted to drop out of engineering in his 3rd year because he just didn’t have the interest/motivation to get an engineering degree. Plus, he had quite a few backlogs. His parents had paid heavy capitation fee for his seat. I am not sure if his parents were ok with him quitting and joining a hospitality degree but he is happy now. I guess he was never interested in engineering in the first place and his parents understood that pushing him wouldn’t bring him to do better. My cousin and his family are rich and I am sure they could have ignored the lost money in capitation but according to me time is money. It’s good that you’ve realized this isn’t working for you. If you think of the situation from an economic and ‘value of time’ stand point, yeah it is a loss but if you’re not going to be happy with doing it then there’s very less value long term. Have a plan and work with focus. Good luck. I dropped out of btech. Please have solid plan and make sure you get a degree.   \\n\\n\\nAlso if you're in 3rd year, do consider finishing your degree Hey OP regardless of whatever you choose to do, take care of yourself.

My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).\\n\\n**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora.

I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else.

I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)\\n2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?\\n3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?\\n4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.\\n\\nPlease dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).\\n\\nAnd sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPS:\\n\\nBy intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.\\n\\nAnd I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)\\n\\nIts not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn\\'t.

Expecting someone to be waiting more than 1/3rd of their life for their future partner is a little absurd imo. There is nothing wrong in that, its just a slim possibility. Also, there is some amount of gatekeeping hypocrisy there. In these kind of prudish thoughts, its always the female who has to remain \\'pure\\' or \\'sanskari\\'. And if you think of it, terms like \\'honry\\', \\'dirty\\' will make way to pious usages like \\'love making\\' for describing sex once marriage is done.\\n\\nPersonally, my future partner\\'s past won\\'t affect me as long as it won\\'t cause any problem with our future. I also think its sweet to share first intimacy with someone special to each other. Anyway, once you are in love, there is no place for past but a future to be together. Here it goes. \\n\\n1. Men who have sex are not pigs. Sex isn\\'t dirty, it\\'s just sex. There\\'s no meaning to it as such, other than what someone gives to it. \\n\\n2. Sex is not correlated with honour. Looking at women as honourable just because she\\'s never had sex is making them an object and passing judgement to their character based on what your male fantasy would want to think. \\n\\n3. Sex is fun. It\\'s nice. It feels good. There you go. Girls get horny too, you know. It\\'s not just you who\\'s been jerking off thrice a day for the past 17 years. \\n\\n4. What bullshit is this partners first and last ? Are y\\'ll objects and properties owning each other ? Sex is just sex, it\\'s fun it\\'s nice. You can compare it to watching movies. The only moral judgement you can pass on it is the morality you attach to sex itself. \\n\\nAnd this is personal (you can read up the sexist origins of monogamy) but in my life I\\'ve been privileged enough to meet some girls I\\'ve been able to love. There\\'s no legitimacy to the idea that everyone has one person for them. People do exist polygamous relationships. Sex is just sex. There\\'s nothing more to it, character, this, that. Nothing. \\n\\n5. Why does it mean so much to you ? Maybe you\\'ve spent your entire life fetishizing sex, but that\\'s not what everyone does. More than, how can you hold someone else responsible for something they did before they even knew you ? Why does your morality have to be overriding ? \\n\\nDon\\'t blame others for the image of life you\\'ve created in your own head. \\n\\n\\n\\nDo try to answer this, why are you fine with first base and not with Sex ? I\\'ll tell you why, cause male thought and society teaches us unconsciously that a woman\\'s value lies in her vagina. If it was her dignity and honour which lied in her body, even someone touching her would be an issue. Why this ?!\\n\\n\\nIf there was some logic to this, you should be more offended by a long term relationship with a guy which will haunt you in the future than some random one night stand with a guy who\\'s name the girl won\\'t even remember. Is this still a thing? I did my college in early 2000s and we were mostly traditional bunch of girls then(aunties now). Those who remained virgins till marriage were so due to lack of opportunity, definitely not due to lack of interest or boyfriends. So yeah, even now, you can find such girls who had no opportunity, just find some girl from a small town or village who has always stayed with parents or better in a joint family. I am not relationship expert but you have mentioned some generalization / stereotypes in your long query.\\n\\n1. Not all men are pigs and just looking for sex. Even most is generalization.\\n\\n2. Sex is not at all associated with honour.\\n\\n3. Sex is subjective and depend upon the individual. For some it is casual and physical. For some it is emotional.\\n\\n4. Nobody indulge in sex just for peer validation.\\n\\n5.  You are not the only one who thinks like that. If you prefer your partner virgin then nothing is wrong with that. But demonize someone who is not virgin is wrong.\\n\\n6. If previous relationship doesn\\'t bother the current relationship then it shouldn\\'t be a cause of worry. And i am personally fine with that. lmao what the fuck is this post If you haven\\'t had any relationships, it\\'s perfectly fine to want someone who also hasn\\'t.\\n\\nI\\'ll be downvoted here, but as long as you\\'re not a hypocrite, you\\'re allowed to have your preferences.\\n\\n\\\\>When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront\\n\\nI don\\'t know if this will work, but you can just tell her that you don\\'t have any past experience and would prefer someone who also doesn\\'t. If she has any decency, she will make up some excuse to back out of the rishta even if she doesn\\'t want to reveal anything.\\n\\nAlso, from what I\\'ve heard from friends, 99% of them will lie and pretend they didn\\'t even if they did have bfs. I think being *very open minded* but a *certain extent* is a classic Indian trope. Fear of society labelling you conservative has led to the invention of such labels. It’s funny. Sounds like an oxymoron. \\n\\nAnyway, as to your question. Having a past isn’t a deal breaker. You had relationships. It doesn’t make a difference. What matters is what is the current situation. Are they still in relationship being forced by their parents? Maybe they are emotionally involved but not acting on it. Blah blah. These things matter more than sexual past. \\n\\nAnd honestly, look for a person you’re compatible with. \\n\\nSociety seems to have trained us to believe virginity = virtue/honor. But it is not so. A girl’s honor is not in her pants. We all need to understand that. \\n\\nIf you like the girl and respect her as an individual and she does the same to you, that should be the basis of a relationship. People have preferences, you have one. If you are not a hypocrite, it\\'s fine. \\n\\nDon\\'t ask her on the first meeting. Maybe on the 2nd or 3rd meeting when she\\'s comfortable with you. \\n\\nTell her about your past and how you would want someone who shares the same thoughts. She\\'ll reject you if she\\'s had some partners. I had similar thoughts. I was 29 then. Virgin, never had a relationship, introvert, nerd, from Govt school in a Tier 2 town, not much English skills and an average looking guy. After I got settled with a good job my parents introduced me to a girl from a metro, our both families met, i spoke with the girl, I told her all about me and asked if she had any relationships before, she said she never had any. she is well educated, working in an MNC , well bought-up, she spoke well, humble smart. We got engaged and then wedding and after a week I looked at her chats and email exchanges, extreme private stuff, sex, i was completely shocked, these were very old like 8 years or so. I didnt care much at first. but I asked her anyway about her past and she denied again. I didnt tell her I saw her emails though.  \\n\\n\\nFastforward a couple of weeks, I further looked into all her accounts, emails, google chats, old FB chats and I learned, she had like 4-5 relationships in the past 8 years, casual sex, relationships were so casual like she was with a guy for like just 2 months. I had no ill feelings for her but atleast she could have told me about all this before things went ahead with us. I confronted her with all this and she told she was afraid that her parents might come to know about her. Things went only south from here. Because she was still regularly speaking with a couple of guys. but only \"friendly\" she claimed.  \\n\\n\\nI still trusted her but things did not end good for us. I could not go ahead with the marriage and wanted to come out of it. But she is smart. It has been few years now and yet life never returned to normal. A part of me hates me for being not so smart enough to see through things early, for not handling things better and making my life a mess. I still cannot think why men/women hide things about their relationships from their husband/Wife? I believe good or bad, it is always better to come clean before marriage. Sooner or later truth eventually will come out and it is not going to end well if you hide your past. It will destroy everyone\\'s lives.

I'll tell them that I'm full but then they'll bring me another portion, and I feel like I must eat it because it would be rude to refuse. Is there a way to tactfully tell them when I've had enough food? The last thing I want to do is disrespect their generosity!\", 1586225965.0, 'AskIndia', 'Welcome to Indian kitchens. This is universal, and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left. This way you can eat their final serving, and continue to flatten your curve as well, so to speak.\\n\\nEdit: Do bring in a dessert sometime. Return the favour! Indian families generally insist on serving more food until you INSIST you are full. It’s a cultural thing. \\n\\nIn older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. This was understood by the host. The hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. \\n\\nThese days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in American culture I observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). But sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. Just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. They will usually understand.\\n\\nAnother thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. This gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.\\n\\nThank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied. \\n\\nHope this helps. Oh boy...I have some good tips for you..\\n\\n1) eat slow\\n2) when you are done, quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plate...so the plate becomes unservable\\n3) just get up and wash your hands when done ....no eye contact. \\n\\n\\nTried and tested in the field.\\nP.S: all techniques tested on my wife\\'s family where I face the same issue. I am fasting today. Typical Indian household lol. It\\'s endearing in a way but tbh I always feel like I can\\'t walk or that I am going to throw up.\\n\\nJust insist that you are full and just ask small quantities of different varieties of food. It wont be that bad once they are used to have you around during lunchtime and get familiar with your portion sizes. Just eat real slow, they will get it that you are having trouble finishing it. Tell them that you will ask if you want more, or that you will take the food by yourself when you want more (e.g tell them “you guys also eat, I’ll take how much ever I want, I don’t want to trouble you”) . Eat slow to match speed of others eating in the house. Or tell that if you eat a lot, you will end up feeling ill. Initially Smile and after 2-3 times, tell politely but firmly with semi-serious face. Many years ago, a fellow American friend I knew in Dilli consumed an entire stick of butter out of politeness. The cultural norm is that as a guest, if you actually do want to be served more food, you only refuse ***mildly.*** Guests will usually not directly say - \"Yes, I do want more\". Instead they will just not protest too strongly when the hosts are serving you more food. So, when you actually do become full and definitely don\\'t want more, you have to politely but very firmly say no. You have to insist, like one of the other comments said. Don\\'t worry, it\\'s not rude. Another tip is - eat slowly. If you finish too fast, they\\'ll think you\\'re still hungry. Why do you think most Indians have a potbelly and are generally unfit? I don\\'t understand what it is with Parents and relatives that they will always put more than you need in your plate and think that its healthy to eat more while it\\'s clearly not. My diet always gets screwed because of my parents overfeeding me even if I refuse to eat more. They just put more on the plate and I have to eat because I don\\'t like wasting food. I need to be more stern otherwise I have to spend more time with my dumbells to shed those extra carbs.'], [\"How do I get my boyfriend's parents to give me a chance?\", 42, 'fvgj13', Subreddit(display_name='india'), 'https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvgj13/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriends_parents_to_give_me_a/', 51, 'I hate being a white girl barging in during a global pandemic to talk about my own shit but if anyone wants to get their mind off of it with some sweet in-law drama, read on.\\n\\nSo we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They\\'re pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he\\'s their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he\\'s dated anyone they\\'ve given him an extremely hard time about it.\\n\\nSwitch to me. I\\'m very in love with him. We\\'ve been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn\\'t stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I\\'m Canadian. I\\'m about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don\\'t want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.\\n\\nSwitch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn\\'t think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we\\'re too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that\\'s plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I\\'m not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like \"I\\'m depressed from all of our financial problems and now you\\'re doing this to hurt me,\" every time he does something they don\\'t like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.\\n\\nWhat we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn\\'t have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat\\'s out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. \\n\\nI don\\'t expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don\\'t want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they\\'ll decide he\\'s \"settled,\" especially if he\\'s settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They\\'re just gonna tell me I\\'m useless for however many minutes. \\n\\nIdk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up.

After few years, once you get a kid, do his/her naming ceremony from your parent in law's house, they will first accept your kid and then yourself. What a nice deviation from the usual gloom and doom. But I think zealous Indian parents may be as bad as the virus. Anyway. \\n\\nThere's nothing so far that you can do. The onus is on your boyfriend. Indian parents, for the most part, in situations like this, will eventually mellow out if the son takes a strict no nonsense attitude. Which is difficult for some Indian men. Being so reliant on the parents as they are.\\n\\nJust be yourself. Don't try to placate them too much. They don't have the right to give you a hard time just because you're not the bride they were expecting. Telugu family..?... Try saying you'll give more dowry... If they are religious, the key is the Horoscope. \\n\\nIt's dumb but that's what it is. Sit down and talk with them. Take the bitter pill. You'd be better of correcting what you missed out on from the start of your relationship - getting to know his parents. Bitter because this won't be easy - they'll humiliate you and test you. Go through it with what you have, but also be prepared to tell them off if they cross any limit - and they will. Call out on their manipulative tactics to your boyfriend - but also be careful there.\\n\\nIndian parents are a strange breed - and that too South Indians.\\n\\nI'm gonna get criticised for saying this, but fuck it: On the note that you're planning for your future, ask yourself, is this the environment you'd want your child to grow up in? Always beware of a toxic environment.\\n\\nAgain, look out for any and all manipulative tactics.\\n\\nWishing you good luck. Stay safe, stranger. Have you considered getting your boyfriend to move to Canada instead of the other way round? At least that way his parents can't forcibly take him back because border control is a legitimate hurdle. Just ignore them and get married. You being white is not the issue, you being someone which their son  chose (instead of them) is the problem. While reading it I could totally relate to the father getting depressed and mother shouting thing. That is exactly what my husbands parents did.(and I am hindu Indian girl, we belong to same fucking religion but is just not somebody who suits their prodigal son)\\nEven if they come around which will be unwillingly it is still going to be difficult for you for some initial years of marriage. \\nJust ignore them, get court marriage done. They will try to emotional blackmail your guy, hope he is smart enough to ignore that.\\nDon’t give in to all the drama of “we are your parents, we did so much for you etc etc”. \\nJust get married and let them come to terms with this on their own.\\nIt is your life and you both are the one who are going to spend it for the rest of your life.\\n\\nAnd if he is NRI then it becomes easy to get married. \\nBut if the boy is from India and you have to get married in Indian court of law then the process is a bit tedious but doable. You cannot make every one happy. If you guys are happy together, you will be miserable apart. \\n\\nGive them space and time. If after sometime, they still don't listen, take a call. \\n\\nHappiness together or misery apart.\\n\\nEither way, take care and stay safe. How fucked up is it that there's a post like this every month? Just tells you about the priorities that Indian Parents have. Good luck OP. Damn i am a telugu indian...spare with my english..ykr.... \\n\\nBasically (no offense to any one)  Brahmin caste is highest in the hierarchy in inian caste system and particularly too orthodox with their traditions customs ect....In indian it's sad but marriages occur inside same castes...but there are exceptions in some cases were people get married to foreigners too.... All indian parents are like that(as u explained) .....basically but u need to figure out how  his parents are ...........\\n\\n1(completely orthodox) these people don't care about their son or daughter but only Honour ..caste and religion always comes into their mind  ..if his parents are like this then u are doomed..........\\n\\n2(little liberal)they care about their son's happiness even sacrificing their honour....take time ...meet them... don't be like typical American...search about ethical wear,customs and traditions of telugu community..meet them in saree if possible..talk to them maturely not like a child  ..try to impress them.. try to be honest and they will accept u.......\\n\\nin general sense indian men are good.....

He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else\\'s life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.\\n\\nMy dad says they\\'ll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn\\'t have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).\\n\\nHe also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, \"they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,\" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?\\n\\nI\\'m currently studying abroad in a Western country where I\\'m obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he\\'d support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he\\'d be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.\\n\\nAuthoritarianism works until it doesn\\'t. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn\\'t affect you or your family.\\n\\nHow do I explain this to him?

All my friends are sanghis too, two of my best friends (like top 5) have turned out to be xenophobic bigots, vocal islamophobes and RSS sympathisers. \\n\\nFor the fascists, it does not matter wether or not there is a minority because if there isn’t a minority, they will create one. If there were no muslims in India, would everyone be Hindu? No. They’d be Brahmins, Dalits and women. Perhaps once people start looking beyond their privileges and start hearing beyond our fascist enabling airwaves maybe a bulb will light up at the end of the tunnel. \\n\\nOur own households are xenophobic, patriarchal and misogynistic.

At the same time, don\\'t hold back from defending your ideas just because people you like may not agree with them What you can do in my humble opinion, is try to show examples from history or even in modern day - where people have been seduced into accepting an authoritarian strongman in the promise of a strong economy or stability (even if it means at the cost of hurting minorities). What we have observed is that these kind of authoritarians aren\\'t able to kickstart the economy in the way they promise.\\n\\nLook at Russia with Putin, Hungary with Viktor Orban, Brazil with Bolsonaro.\\n\\nYoj could also make the economic argument that persecuting minorities makes the country unfavorable to investment, to businesses and for the economy in general. Conflict and social tension decreases cohesiveness and in turn increases the probability of a tail risk.\\n\\nTake for example the protests in delhi, for the large majority of hindus, they aren\\'t probably affected themselves, but the protests have cemented a reputation of India turning into a hostile state for minorities globally.\\n\\nThere\\'s no point arguing over morality with people who have already given in to the dark side, if you want to change their opinions you have to be pragmatic and argue from the focus that personally affects them. Persecution of minorities doesn\\'t affect them directly and thus they don\\'t care, or they might even personally condone it. But showing how such acts can negatively affect themselves can change their position to a more moderate stance from their current veering towards extremist ideology. I\\'m in the same situation as OP.  My dad was never religious, he had many muslim friends but, now he has started making hateful comments. I tried to reason with him but he made an argument that because he is in the country, he knows better.\\n\\nI hate that the pandemic is being communalised in India and I cannot let him have his beliefs when, his beliefs are based on whatsapp news and TRP hungry, propaganda pushing media channels. \\n \\nNow, I listen to the anti muslim news he has ( like I\\'m genuinely interested to know), I then share fact checked articles on it and complain about shitty media.

Which I think is nowhere near enough. \\n\\n* United States had around 5000 cases before March 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on March 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.\\n\\nEven if we’re on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the Nizamuddin Dargah, hundreds of people celebrating Ram Navmi despite lockdown, Dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on April 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it’s Diwali... So, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they’d mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it’d started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. \\n\\nAlso if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we’ll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve.

I'd say 1) Ramp up testing rates 2) Ensure everyone has masks to wear 3) Revoke lockdown in phases I feel like places will be more highly crowded than usual with people who are desperate to go out.\\n\\nI think we’ll all be waking up to a new reality after this lockdown is lifted.  I feel many more people will continue to get infected and die. # NO\\n\\nwait, lockdown? The one we break every Sunday? Lockdown without a comprehensive testing strategy and a phased release would be ineffective and perpetual. we have actually wasted these 14 days by not testing enough. should have tested around 5 L people by now. The extension of lockdown is necessary now. No. If it's really required, we should open up cities and districts (for travel inside these zones) with no cases, but people should not be able to enter or leave these zones. In my area I know families which are really struggling to accumulate money for upcoming months.\\nThey have issues like money to pay for childrens school, they are not earring anything right now how they are going to sustain any expenditure in future months. \\nThose families somehow managing their food with government support and relatives debt but man believe me situation is do or die for them...\\nThey need a way to earn money, so in that sense lockdown should be uplifted.\\n\\nAt least for them... The real number of cases in India is at least 10 times the official number of cases. We know that a majority of novel Coronavirus cases are asymptomatic, i.e. no cough and cold, no fever, no breathing distress. Among the 20%-25% cases which are symptomatic, very few have symptoms severe enough to warrant a visit to the hospital (let's say 10% of the real number of infected cases, I don't have any stats to back up this number, I just pulled it out of thin air), and only 2%-3% will die. \\n\\nConversations with doctors (and their FB posts) in many rural districts of my home state (WB) have shown me that the situation is dire. Doctors and nurses finally have enough PPE, but the overwhelming number of cases has totally destroyed the brittle public health infrastructure. Most patients with COVID-19 symptoms are just getting pneumonia and malaria medicines, and are being sent home, because there aren't enough testing kits, and not nearly enough beds.\\n\\nMake no mistake, the real, actual number of people infected in India could well be past 1 crore at this point, and we still wouldn't know unless the govt AGGRESSIVELY ramps up testing. In such a situation, where so many migrant workers who've returned to their villages as asymptomatic carriers, in addition to people who've attended various religious gatherings, the national lockdown doesn't really matter. It won't stop the spread any further. It is over, coronavirus has won, and a population roughly the size of Dharavi is expendable. Well. I'd like to be out and about again but its very difficult for me to decide. I'd like things to be normal but we have a pathetic medical system and we wont be able to control the spread of the virus if we do.

It is basically not using your phone, pc or anything you feel is time wasting but you like using/doing it anyways. So basically you don't use any of those things as soon as you wake up, because once your brain releases too much dopamine everything else less interesting would feel boring to do and you would procrastinate alot. Inshort get all your important work done then use your phone, internet. First things first, if you are physically tired it's a medical problem, not a mental problem.\\n\\nTake care of the fundamentals first: drink enough water, eat enough food, get enough sleep. Reduce the amount of fat you consume, especially saturated fat. Try some physical activity (cleaning up your house, rearranging things is physical activity). Talk to a doctor, try to get some tests for anemia, Vitamin D, diabetes etc. You may well have a medical problem.\\n\\nNow leaving aside the physical problem, you may well have anxiety issues - I had that too for decades, and therapy changed my life.

A dream of escaping the harsh realities of India. And evidently, this dream persists today, too. People are absolutely sure that get admitted to an IIT will set their life on track. Anyone who does get admitted becomes a celebrity in the eyes of \"IIT aspirants\" - a sizable student community in India. These \"IITians\" started using Quora around 2014/2015, writing about a variety of topics. Soon, the IIT aspirants flocked over and made EVERYTHING about IITs, \"What do IITians eat?\", \"When do IITians get married?\", even worse was when IITians themselves started not just entertaining these ridiculous questions, but also embraced them. Their bios simply read \"IITK 2k18\" or \"IIT+IIM\" and that is enough for whatever they say to be upvoted to heaven. An example Quora\\'s degeneration can be seen in the Jack Fraser controversy. Jack Fraser, an Oxford PhD student in Natural Sciences, claimed to have \"easily solved\" the IIT-JEE exam. This remark was enough to enrage an army of IIT aspirants and IITians to go and mercilessly harass Fraser. Alas, this degeneration continues, and the cult around IITs grows ever stronger.

You'll have to kill them and destroy their eggs. If you don't have pesticide, it's okay, you can make something that's equally effective. Mix some dettol/lizol/colin with some detergent and spray it on the bug/egg. The bugger will die almost instantly. Get hold of a sprayer or fiddle around with an old deodorant/perfume bottle. Spray the mix on all 12 edges of the bed as that's where these bugs are most likely to stay and hide. Scan the cot as well, especially the hidden corners and edges. That's the most common place they lay eggs. Tiny white specks.   \\nAlso, you might want to leave the bed and cot out in the sun after this spraying session to get rid of the detergent smell. Remove the bugs from your pillow and sleep on the floor for a while till you can get bed bug repellent. Getting rid of them can be frustrating if you don't know where they are coming from. You need to filling in all little gaps in your bed where they can hide , and and start drowning them with the repellent. Can you order diatomaceous earth from Amazon? It's one of the ways to deal with bedbugs. Bedbugs don't respond well to heat, can you keep your bedding in the sun for a while? Dru your pillows and bedsheets under direct sun for few days.

We immediately washed all the bedsheets and pillow covers in boiling water and picked the remaining ones by hand. We did this for 2 consecutive days after which they were gone. No pesticide or pest control guys. Since you've had them for a while, you'll need to do this for your entire home, even the clothes you'll wear, towels and stuff.

It always comes to that and therefore most of the time, just one of them is never enough Torrent I have all three. While I spend a lot of time on Netflix, out of the three I have to say prime is the most valuable. Prime Music + Prime delivery + New movies within 30 days (prime video) - all for just 1000 a year is too good.\\n\\nHostar has become a waste of money this year due to poor GOT season, no IPL. Netflix is the best no doubt. When you aren't searching for anything particular, you can always end up finding something you like. The Netflix originals are amazing, with foreign language ones like Platform and Dark being an added cherry on top.\\n\\nAmazon Prime gets latest hindi movies, but not so useful for me since I visit theaters a lot. I use it only for specific series like Young Sheldon or Jack Ryan. But prime is a must for me coz I use Prime Music. Although it has highest quality of 256 kbps, it's music has aac encoding which sounds better to me than Spotify's 320 kbps mp3 ones. There is also Prime delivery. For only video streaming, I don't find it that interesting.\\n\\nHotstar is great if you like the specific kind of catalogue it has, like GoT Chernobyl etc., and there are also some hindi originals; it is also good for the latest hindi serials and the various news channels (some you can also see in JioTV). Now that it includes Disney+, you can see all the movies of Disney/Marvel/Pixar too, be it Star Wars or Frozen or Avengers, and their spin off shows. You also get National Geographic documentaries. Overall, I would say it is a better option than prime. YouTube zindabad!\\n\\nSeriously tho, I've all 3 and Netflix despite being pricey, has a humongous library. They have the most stable streaming protocol, and overall tech wise they're the best. The regional library is comparatively small, but have some pretty high quality films.\\n\\nNext up, Prime is definitely the most bang for your buck. We use Amazon a lot, so it's great for delivery. Prime has a modest library and has some great high quality shows. I use prime mainly for regional films, a few web series, and if you're into the stand up comedy scene, it's totally worth it. But I feel prime has the least stable streaming quality unless you've got a strong stable connection ( home use is great).\\nPrime music is okay and useful if you have Alexa, but I prefer Spotify due to superior UI/UX and waaay bigger library.(I listen to a lot of Indie stuff)\\n\\nHotstar has recently hiked fees to 1500, it's okay If you're into the few HBO shows that are there, or Disney content, or it's very selective library, it may be worth. If you have kids or elders around, the content on there might appeal to them more. Personally, not too happy, but GOT and Silicon Valley, so it was ok. Yet to explore Disney library fully though. I use hotstar more for live TV and cricket. It's streaming is stable, but quality is not too good\\n\\nHonorary Mention: Airtel Xstream comes free with the plan, it's pretty good considering it's free, there's a decent number of movies and shows on it, plus the Zee5 library. I had watched a few seasons of BBT and some Hindi movies. i use piracy premium service.

Is the money you receive inadequate in some way for you to enjoy your life and indulge in those activities you find pleasurable? Instead of looking at how much your peers make in simplistic calculations of monthly salary, ask yourself what you want to do, where you want to go, and if what you do fulfills you.

If the only thing that is weighing you down is the belief that your friends are doing better, and otherwise you are satisfied with life, then I\\'d say stop worrying about stuff like this.

Her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names.\\xa0\\n\\nKumari said in an interview: ‘I was born with this defect and I couldn’t be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. ‘\\n\\nAs she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. She feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can’t fight a long battle with superstitions. Therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.\\n\\nIt has now been 63 years that I have had this condition. She said in the interview, ‘The residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that I am a witch and keep away from me. They sometimes come to see my condition – but never help. ‘I am forced to stay indoors as I am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.’\\n\\nOne of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of Kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. And, Kumari’s medical condition has made her the witch of the village.\\n\\nOn hearing Kumari’s situation, government officials of India have decided to come to her aid. She is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. Even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.\\n\\nIn 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. Even though the government of India is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases.\\xa0\\n\\nLet's hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.\\xa0\\n\\nWatch video- [Women with 31 fingers called a witch throughout her life](https://streakshot.com/weird-news/women-with-31-fingers)\", 1584384916.0, 'AskIndia', \"Heartless people.

It's all about how you sell it. Lots of Indians default to shunning and hating the thing that they don't understand. But if her family/relatives sold the idea as an incarnation of a goddess, she would have people praying to her and offering her and her family, tons of respect and fear. I can't imagine the mental stress she had to go through. 63 years of being socially isolated and humiliated. That's more than what most people can take.

My concern is that they aren't fans of secularism yet are very pro-UCC, which sounds paradoxical and makes me wonder what the motivation is, if that makes sense. Lift beef ban. You can't allow special treatment for some religious laws. Firstly, the Civil code defines the relationships between two or more individuals and not the relationship between an individual and the state. The lack of an uniform civil code doesn't mean that there is any discrimination on the basis of religion when it comes to the relationship between the state and an individual.\\n\\nSecondly, it would be difficult to impose a civil code in India due to the huge variation of beliefs and customs among communities within the country. For example, marriages between close cousins are common in parts of TN, that are otherwise illegal in rest of India. If one believes that all these variations in customs should be respected, an uniform civil code is a non-starter. Abhi sab thande baste mein daal diya hai. Check after June 2020. Uniform Civil Code will be a boon for Indian Muslims as a whole, if implemented uniformly that is. Most of the Muslim personal laws are bad for Muslim women, thereby stopping them from progressing in the society. 50% of the demographics held back because Muslim men can't let go of the power and control they have over Muslim women. Having laws that stop that will benefit the entire Muslim community. Only the regressive orthodox Muslim men will lose some privilege here. \\n\\n\\nGoing by the past records, the BJP government will never implement it uniformly. They'll only focus on how it can used a beating stick to harm the Muslim community even more. Even Congress under Rajiv Gandhi did the same, who also toyed with gaining the support of Hindutwadis, so we can't expect any better from the worse alternative. As  usual, there is no discussion as to what this UCC would be?\\nJust stating that there should be, does not matter much and given past and current BJP policies has to be viewed with suspicion at least. \\n\\nHaving separate civil codes for the religions is perhaps what makes it secular as all of the major religions are represented. \\nSecular does not mean lack of religion. It only means that the state does not prefer one religion over another. \\nWhat is UCC?\\nExplain it in more than just a one liner and then we can discuss. Again this is just a fear of people. The implementation of UCC may follow the modus operandi of CAA. CAA alone could have been beneficial to some illegal migrants from neighbouring countries but it was coupled with NRC and hence had mass opposition. \\n\\n\\nHence there is a fear of what may be implemented in the name of UCC. There are chances of taking away religious freedom enshrined in constitution. Many countries across the world allow personal laws of each community as long as they are not going against the constitution. \\n\\nLike triple Talaq was made illegal as per demand of Muslim women but the government also made it criminal act by introducing jail terms by the BJP on its own without any such demands from the women organisation. Why? It is such actions from the government that make people wary of BJP and its aim in introducing UCC. \\n\\nBTW India is not a secular nation, so maybe they should just declare it a Hindu rashtra and just enshrine protection for minorities in constitution including reservation like in Pakistan.

I took in two stray kittens, they mostly stay indoors but sometimes go outside. A few months ago I was feeding them boiled chicken and one of their teeth touched my finger, I wasn't sure if I bled but I went to the hospital, told them what happened. They gave me 4 shots on days 0,3,7 and 28 and asked me to get a booster a year later. Today while I was about to go out, one of them bit me on the leg through pants. I was wearing thick jeans at the time but I did feel her teeth, I went outside but I had a bit of realization 10 minutes in and decided to check my leg. I couldn't find a wound, I dont believe she penetrated through the clothes and it didnt seem like that strong of a bite either. But I still washed it with soap and water about 20 minutes after I got the bite and then I went to the hospital. The doctor there didn't even know what days they were supposed to administer the doses and kept confusing me but then he started writing the 4 dose vaccine again and I told him I already took it 2 months ago. Then he said I don't need anything and simply recommended me a tetanus shot. I took the tetanus shot but I'm growing increasingly paranoid. It's been almost 2 hours since that bite. I've checked on Google in some cases the wound is so tiny you need a magnifying glass to see it. This guy didn't even ask me where I was bitten, if I was bitten, if I bled, as soon as he heard cat bite he'd started writing. I don't know if I should trust him, I'm kind of a paranoid person. I live in a small town so there's no private hospitals here, there's private clinics but they don't open till 5 pm. I don't know, what do I do?\", 1586962344.0, 'AskIndia', \"Chill. You took the 4 shots a few months ago right? You don't need to take anything other than a customary tetanus shot which you have taken. You are fine. The doctor was right. And technically it should hold you for a minimum of 2 years without a booster and that too if you are in a high exposure condition.\\n\\nAlso, did you not take a tetanus shot when you took the rabies shots? If so, this tetanus shot was totally not required 10 year old me used to calculate my potential death date 21 days from then and then feel a slight relief when it passed. Then I became careful around cats when I noticed one with rabies in Kochi. Your rabies shots you took a few months ago is enough. But if you're paranoid - get it.   \\nAlso thumb rule - if an animal bites you, and it's not dead in 10 days, it's not rabid. It's nice to love pets till you get ARVs . Don’t risk it. Cats give puncture wounds and you might be at risk. Get the shots. Did you not receive a RIG? I didn't either. Although i took preexposure treatment, i asked the doctor to administer 5 doses that are given for postexposure because i wasn't sure. Why were you given 4 for a confirmed bite? Also, since you've already been vaccinated and it have been over 3 weeks since then, your body would have developed sufficient antibodies against the virus by now. So don't worry. I get sratched/ bitten by strays almost ever other day. On a side note, don't let your cats outside and get then vaccinated as soon as possible. Just saying that rabies has nearly a 100% kill rate. If you get rabies, youre fucked. Be precautions as fuck.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, dying from rabies is a really awful way to go. you dont need it as its a pet animal and probably isn't rabid. plus your course of 5 shots is good for a year atleast. I've been bitten and scratched but cats and kitten till my adulthood. I'm doing fine. Yes I did and i dont think my kitten is rabid or ill. She drinks water and eats food just fine. I can't find a real wound on my leg and I was wearing jeans on top so her teeth breaking through the jeans and then through skin, the chances are severely low. Its just really scary cause the kittens aren't vaccinated. I would like to vaccinate them asap but because of the coronavirus it's a bit difficult. The vetenary hospital here is bare bones, he asked me to wait until the lockdown is over.\\n\\nI did take the tetanus shot back when I took the rabies shot but this doctor asked me to take it again so I did.

I so don\\'t want this culture to be promoted. Not a good news, IAS officers come in daily contact with many people. I would worry about **three** people handling a baby daily in current circumstances. Nice PR Doesn\\'t India have laws regarding paid maternity leave? Why would you come to your job with your child, especially in such times?\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but I find nothing praiseworthy here.

I am glad to find a lot of comments here calling her out. Even removing the dangerous situation she is putting her child in the current state of affairs, this is nothing praiseworthy or exemplary. Women who have delivered baby/had csection needs proper rest and recovery period. That\\'s why maternity leave exists. I had to go back to work at 12 weeks leaving my newborn to a care taker. I had to pump 3 times at office and still be productive as my male colleagues. After coming from office, I don\\'t have time to rest because I need to relieve the care taker and let her rest. I couldn\\'t sleep well, because baby needs to be fed every few hours through night as well. Then there is the overhead of cleaning and sterilizing bottles and pump parts. Delivery is traumatic. Csection is a major surgery. Women should be allowed to recover and dedicate their time to their babies before joining back to workforce. They will be more productive that way. Glorifying toxic work culture is more damaging than anything. I feel this is just a publicity gimmick!\\n\\nWhy is that so many IAS officers who are doing some incredible work (especially related to tribal people) are not publicised? Why are they not seen in trending news or searches? Wait, I thought maternity leave is compulsory. A female can waive the leave? While I\\'m impressed with her dedication, I agree with every other commenter. She is jeopardising the child\\'s life by coming in to work in this scenario. \\n\\nPlus, maybe I\\'m jaded but this feels more like a publicity stunt than anything else. Feel free to correct me. I\\'m a pessimistic person by nature and I feel like this is just a show to prove how \"work trumps all\" is her motto or whatever.\\n\\nBut on a cheerier note, congratulations on the baby.

In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.\\n\\nYou can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?\\n\\nI am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.\\n\\nWhat do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?\\n\\nEdit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.\", 1587240047.0, 'Non-Political', \"Bhai, correlation is not causation. Education plays a bigger role with religiosity.\\n\\nIndia theoretically has a public healthcare system AND social security. The quality and accessibility is another thing, of course My first impulse is to agree. If we had affordable and universal healthcare for example, the snake oil vending babas and fakirs wouldn’t hold as much sway as they currently do.\\n\\nBut on second thoughts, is this really true? Lots of Muslim majority countries have universal free healthcare. Tunisia for example. That didn’t stop them from being an Islamic State hotbed. Saudi Arabia? The less said the better. Bangladesh, our neighbor has a very robust public health system. And yet, it’s secularism is little more than a fake veneer. Majoritarianism is open and out there for anyone to see.\\n\\nAnd then there is Maldives. The country that has the highest number of Islamic State volunteers to the ISIS. 5 people out of 10000 Maldivians went and joined the ISIS.\\n\\nEdit: had written the Maldivian stat wrong. Corrected. [removed] I may be wrong but among the Indian states Kerela offers the above welfare facilities, due a CPI(M) or INC. Yet among all Indian muslims to join ISIS. I recall Kerela being a hotbed for it.\\n\\nCan someone explain that correlation? (and I don't mean to offend anyone just curious.) [deleted] People still believe in caste and religion etc because they have been brought up that way. And since most of the people are not keen to learn different points of view the only way its effects can be decreased in our country is time, particularly when the younger generation takes over the old.   \\n\\n\\nWhat you said is probably true in India for certain people but most people won't vote for anyone outside their caste (atleast locally) Education and higher standard of living will address this by far. Once people become accustomed to good life without day to day worries there is less tendency to look elsewhere for succor. Religion steps in when people are insecure about their circumstances and believe a higher power controls their destiny which is exploited by charlatans. Sabka maalik ek. People think way more rationally when they are not under alot of stress. In western europe many people are religious but they live a peaceful life, so they avoid risking it all by becoming a religious fanatic. Point being, comfort and rationality are directly correlated. This is my theory of course. Fair enough. \\n\\nBut for me, as someone earlier stated in this thread, education is the most important factor to reduce the effect of religion. And I am not talking about mere reading, writing, and eventually sending kids to do engineering. I am talking about an education system which encourages students to be more inquisitive. \\nStudents should always be taught to ask questions and I cannot emphasize this point enough. Through this, students will develop a tendency to critically examine the things they are taught. They will cross check the news they see and ask for concrete proofs for what their parents, teachers, leaders tell them. Eventually, they will realize that theocracy can never provide them such proofs and the arguments it can present is either ambiguous or straight up fictional in nature. Every jumla will be nibbed off before it can reach the masses. \\nTeach children to question. Nurture curiosity.

Over 1,000 people were injured.\\n\\nSome facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:\\n\\n1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.\\n2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.\\n3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.\\n4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.\\n5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.\\n6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings\\n7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.\\n8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.\\n9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.\\n10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.\\n11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.\\n12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.\\n13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.\\n14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.\\n15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.\\n16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations\\n17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.\\n18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.\\n19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.\\n20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.\\n21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.\\n22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.\\n23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British\\n24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been \"confronted by a  revolutionary army\", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  \"Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves\\n25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  \"unutterably monstrous\", while Asquith called it \"one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history\".\\n26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  \"The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.\"\\n27. After Churchill\\'s speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.\\n28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.\\n29. Colonel Michael O\\'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.\\n30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.\\n31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.\\n\\n# Shaheed Uddham Singh\\n\\n1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O\\'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940\\n2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment \\n3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O\\'Dyer.\\n4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940\\n5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:\\n\\n>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?\\n\\nSingh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).\\n\\n# Following his conviction, he made a speech\\n\\nwhich the judge directed should not be released to the press.\\\\[9\\\\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material\\n\\nHe started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:\\n\\n>\"I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .\"  \\n>  \\n>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  \\n>  \\n>\"I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  \\n>  \\n>\"I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  \\n>  \\n>\"I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ \"Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  \\n>  \\n>\"Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  \\n>  \\n>\"You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.\"  \\n>  \\n>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  \\n>  \\n>\"You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  \\n>  \\n>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  \\n>  \\n>\\'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!\"  \\n>  \\n>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHis remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.\\n\\n# Picture thread: [https://imgur.com/a/L5kbEBc](https://imgur.com/a/L5kbEBc)\\n\\nSources & Material you should read:\\n\\n1.

This is the height of stupidity now, This guy is a lunatic who just cares about his image, he knows nothing himself neither he listens to any of the experts around him. He's always ready with a speech but no plan.\\n\\nP.S. I'm gonna say it one way or another, Let's see how long you guys can pretend that the problem does not exist! Other than throwing new jumlas every week, this government has failed to manage lock down  from all aspects. \\n\\nNeither States nor bhakts can keep on feeding people struck due to lock down. \\n\\nEverybody is running out of cash and food. This is what happens, when someone bites more than he can chew. The govt should not be a one man show. Critics are to be heard especially when nation is at an imminent threat of collapse. I think the best thing we as Indians can do now is to help these people however we can. In my own home we have the maid extra raise for this lockdown and reduced her hours to just once a day. \\n\\nTry helping people in your own ways and that way we can truly show the spirit of nationality and humanity. waiting for the govt to do anything will be bad not just for us as humans but these people too. Know anybody who could accept cash to help the starving? And this gobarmint made it worse to manage its numbers:\\n\\n>The reduction in the food subsidy bill, from Rs 1,84,220 crore in the budget estimate for 2019-20 to Rs 1,08,688.35 crore, has been brought about by a simple accounting sleight of hand. Page 43 of the latest Receipts Budget shows the Food Corporation of India (FCI) undertaking additional borrowings of Rs 1,10,000 crore from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) in 2019-20. That figure is budgeted to go up to Rs 1,36,600 crore in the coming fiscal. By getting the FCI to borrow more to fund the food subsidy — which arises from the corporation having to sell wheat at Rs 2 per kg and rice at Rs 3 per kg for the PDS, as against their respective actual economic cost of around Rs 25 and Rs 36 — the Centre has managed to keep its own outgo lower than what it would have been.\\n\\n\\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/business/budget/fci-borrowings-to-be-more-than-centres-food-subsidy-bill-6246648/ He did say that some restrictions will be lifted on 20 April. This will allow poor people to work and restock Assuring the poor people on national TV may not be a wise idea politically...they might realise it is part of the government's job. Instead hopefully they will at least provide the food relief and communicate it as a gracious favor by the benevolence of Modeshwar.

Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.\\nThis month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.\\nAfter the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.\\nNow, on the second and third day they didn\\'t change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn\\'t provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. \\nHis bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.\\nAnd for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it\\'s us who is making the mistake.\\nAnd to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less.

So, the lowest bidder wins. As long as people are willing to work without protection and as long as the government doesn't force it nationwide, there will continue being this issue of neglect. Safety gear and procedures are western constructs. Indian culture is where you say god's name for protection and have a glass of gaumutra. ^(/s) I am a diy guy and I love watching such videos on YT. It's always a difference to notice between the Indian and Videshi diy (mostly woodworking kinda stuff) videos. They'd be wearing safety goggles, helmet, field shoes, jeans, jackets, gloves - basically inside some army level armour using a benchsaw kinda thing to cut a stick and meanwhile, my *Bharatiya Shilpakaar*s will be wearing kachchas and cutting timbers with hacksaw that their carpenter forgot at their house. (Obviously a bit of exaggeration but some will definitely be able to relate to this.) A lot of Indians come to work in Nepal, mainly in construction, carpentry, metal sectors. And what really hurts is seeing little kids and young adults use heavy/loud tools, especially while drilling, sawing, or carving granite, marble etc. They work without protecting their ears and eyes. Every time I see someone being so careless, I try to make a point. Poor fellows simply don't have any idea about the damages they incur without using noise cancelling headphones and other equipments.

Long ago, Sohni, daughter of a potter and Mahiwal, a buffalo herder were in love. Sohni’s family was deadset against her marriage with Mahiwal as he was not from their community. Her parents marry her away to someone else. Mahiwal renounces the world and lives as a fakir (hermit) in a hut across the Chenab river from Sohni’s new home.\\n\\nTo meet Mahiwal, every night Sohni used to cross the Chenab river with the help of an inverted **baked** claypot to cross the river. Soon rumours spread about Sohni – Mahiwal’s romantic rendezvous. One day, Sohni’s sister-in-law secretly replaced the baked claypot with an unbaked claypot to put an end to that problem. That night when Sohni tried to cross the Chenab river the unbaked claypot inevitably dissolved in the water, she started drowning. Mahiwal who was seeing this from the other side of the river jumped in the river to try and save his Sohni. Both drowned and died only to be united after death. Here\\'s a famous folk song/poem which captures this so beautifully, ki kya bataun.\\n\\n[Paar chana de | coke studio | Noorie, Shilpa Rao](https://soundcloud.com/raja-abdar-rahman/paar-chanaa-de-shilpa-rao-noori-episode-4-coke-studio-season-9) Start this song in the background as you read the lyrics and its translation below.\\n\\n*Paar chana de disse kulli yaar di*\\n\\n*Ghariya ghariya aa ve ghariya*\\n\\nTL: Right there across the chenab river lies my beloved’s hut.

Being unsound and unsteady, I cannot but fail in carrying you across the unsound can only reach an unsound end this is a truth known to all.\\n\\n*Kacheyaan te rakhiye na umeed paar di*\\n\\n*Ariye ariye haan ni ariye*\\n\\nDon’t rely on the unsound to help you reach the shore.

C.G.etc ) have the exams in March. So we are 3 months behind. 3 months is achievable, but ...\\n\\nNExT happens just after final year. We don\\'t have 1 more year ( internship wala)\\n\\nSo now... 2017 batch has 2 years... While 2017 batch of MP has just 1.5 years with the lockdown delay\\n\\nAnd let me add a little more cream - its not fixed whether this lockdown will last more \\n\\nThey ( not MP students ) have had a good leave for a month. Even if an average student is considered... He has easily done worth 3 months in this month thanks to online pG classes.\\n\\nMeanwhile we have been just sitting ducks. Revise the 2nd year, or start 3rd year. Weigh it out. \\n\\nEasy to say that you start your 3rd year now if you are worried so much. I could have, if the exams were as easy as school exams. \\n\\nEven the govt recommended syllabus gave us 2 years for studying the 12 clinical subjects for 2 years. They are very important.\\n\\nConsidering revision... One has to do the same in 1 year... Along with prepping for his University exams.\\n\\nSo...

That's when Dr. Rafiqul Islam from Bangladesh and Dr. Dillip Mahalanabis from India decided to administer ORS solution to the patients, it brought down the mortality rate to 3.6% from 30%.\\n\\nApparently, they bought sugar and salt and engaged the healthy people in the camps to prepare drums full of ORS solution. Both healthy and the sick were then given the solution to drink. Ultimately a simple homemade preparation ended up saving the lives of millions.\\n\\nWHO estimates that a fistful of sugar and three pinches of salt have saved more than 70 million lives.

I feel that every insecurity or fear of ours is due to our parents.They are the one who shaped our childhoods and have either consciously or sub-consciously made our minds. Be it our commitment issues, power issue, abandonment issue or what not everyone of it could be tracked to our parents. During childhood, having knowledge of nothing we try to imitate the people around us consider their reactions toward a situation as deafult.  I believe to curb this parents should open a dialogue with their children and not scold or supress their every little whim, they should talk it out. And I think we must question our family structures even if causes a lot of strain its for the better. \\n\\nAlso i think teenage or early 20s is the best time to talk about this with parents cause we too are fresh with ideas from society, wanting to do something different and our parents aren\\'t old enough to die of a broken heart. Also i think there should **psychological study of criminals so we could find out what was that trigger that made them do that heinous crime**. For e.g The incident in Gargi college wasn\\'t due to bad management it was due to bad parenthood where the parents didn\\'t taught their children to respect the space of fellow human being. Blaming the management is like shooting someone in the head and blaming that the police wasnt present to stop us. Is it ok to loot each other home or kill each other if the law that put these act as punishable was removed? Kya sad rha hai garpe baithke bc.

[deleted] Inspired by u/visionerarchitect \\'s story of his first income here\\'s mine - \\n\\n\\nOnce upon a time jab RheaLabs naya naya 10th class pass hui thi. Din bhar sirf beauty blogs padhti rehti thi. Fir ek din I saw ki wahan ek \"Join Us\" ka tab tha , who knew ki one day this \"Join us\" thing will shape a big part of my personality.  It was about writing guest blog posts , so what you had to do was to send them an email with a sample blog post and some pictures , say Agar tumhari post is a product review so  usse related images and sample post and certain information about you . So I sent my first application to my favorite beauty blog of at that time which was also India\\'s biggest beauty blog us samay (I think it still is), ek baar bheja , phir 2-4 baar bheja par no reply . Then maine almost top k  sare  jitne famous blogs ko bhej diye usme se some blogs replied and sabne yahi bola ki *posts thik hai but they only accept pictures taken from DSLR* pr uss Time RheaLabs kaise Lati DSLR . Phir thode time baad I had started reading blog of this girl jisko start kiye hue jyada time nahi hua tha and thoda chhota , kam famous sa blog tha. She didnt used to take/pay for guest  posts but *mai thi desperate* toh maine usko bhi email kr diya. And fir uska reply aya ki *we dont accept guest posts and mere blog ka sara content mai hi likhti solely* toh maine reply me dala ki mujhe paise nhi chahiye I just wanna write . Toh usne accept kar liya , us time mere paas itne products toh rehte nhi the so mai mostly DIY posts hi likhti thi (abhi dekh ke lagta hai they were cringey AF) fir aise time chalte gaya and dhere dhere uska blog also became a little famous . But usne bhi kabhi mujhe paise k liye nahi bola and maine bhi nahi bola qki hmari dosti hogayi thi bohot achhi toh I didnt want this thing to come  between our friendship and isliye bhi because I loved doing  it and it  became my escape from reality . Phir mai 12 th class me pohoch gayi and ek din uska call aya (we were pretty close so we shared each others contact number) ki RheaLabs mai apne blog me paid guest posts start krne wali hoon . I said  ki okay toh she was like abhi 2-3 months lagenge start hone me but teri jo posts hogi abse uske liye mai tujhe pay karungi AND teri posts ke niche tera naam likha hoga . So, what we had agreed initially was mai jo usko posts deti thi she didnt used to mention mera naam in those posts and wo posts bhi uss ke naam se publish hoti and when she said ki meri posts me abse mera naam ayega it was a big thing for me . Mera first ever recognition .  it was like isi din k liye toh mai kaam kar rahi thi isi ke liye toh mai zinda hoon !!! \\n\\nBaki blogs toh waise jyada dete the but she used to pay INR 100 per post at that time  toh pure month me maine jitne posts likhe uske hisaab se next month ke 10th tak mujhe wo paise milte the . \\n\\nFirst month me I gave  a total of 29 posts toh mujhe mile the INR 2900 .

In few minutes, the whole area was jam-packed with a huge crowd and total chaos prevailed.

He came to him and asked: ‘Sir, Can you please go?’\\n\\nRajnikanth replied: ‘That’s what I had asked you then. But you told me to wait. It’s okay. I don’t mind waiting.

Increased my speed a bit and the guy shot off like a rocket.  Thought it was done and went back to my speed. Eventually caught up with him as he slowed down even more  and was waiting for me.

I had a crush on every single one of them... \\n\\nSo one day, after the class, as I was waiting for my driver bhaiyaa to pick me up... I saw , lets call her Rishika , standing alone. I had seen her come with her mom on a scooty , so I assumed she was waiting for her. \\n\\nNow kismat call it ,my driver bhaiya and her mom were both late ( please shut off your dirty mind ) . So I went to her and asked about who she was waiting for... Then we got to talking. I offered her to drop her home, to which she refused. Still, we were now friends. \\n\\nDays went on, we got closer. She was really cute and to the ground. I even started dropping and picking her after and before the class. Driver bhaiya didn\\'t tell my parents, he was a bruh. \\n\\nOn the last day of the class, just before the boards, I felt that I will miss my chance as I was choosing Commerce ( I was no man for PCM or B ) and she was trying to get Science.\\n\\nSo I \\' proposed \\' her.

And I just left. \\n\\nPoor young me, yet unknown to the world \\n\\nMonth or two later , her other girl friends tell me that she was using for car rides. She told them so, and also that she thought I was just a rich snob. She liked using me for car rides.\\n\\nShe could have been honest herself , I mean.... Still...

Photography is cut throat career and is one that entirely depends on you as an individual . If you think doing photograpy > earning money, go for it. It means you have a passion and  photography is the most important thing for you regardless of how much it pays. If not, yeah focus on something solid for earning money and upskill yourself in photograpy. It\\'s a good dream but if you want to make serious money as a photography, it\\'s VERY hard in India. Also being a professional photographer is not the same as being interested in it. The grind can make you start hating it tbh. I honestly would say stick to a career where you can make money and keep photography on the side. Spend at least 4-5 years as an ametuer and see if you still enjoy. Use the money you earn to get better gear. Imo professional photography nowadays depends on not only your own creative talent,but your ability to reach out and connect to people. In other words get out there!And  make sure to maintain a good portfolio.Oh and also patience,lots and lots of patience.\\n\\nAnd no,you do not need a degree of any sorts(Many good photographers are self taught). DM me .....your story sounds like mine. I also love photography and helped a friend establish a photography business by working very closely. I\\'ll give you the whole PICTURE of professional photography in india Follow your dreams bro... Most people are good at multiple things - but the key is to find something that can make money to pay the bills while you dabble in other things you enjoy.\\n\\nPhotography is a tough field to make money in - esp. when every tom dick and harry has a camera on his  phone and thinks s/he is a cool photographer.\\n\\nBut I do know someone who has done VERY WELL in photography and is very well known in nature and wildlife photography. He has repeatedly talked about how wildlife photography is his love, while teaching photography actually pays his bills.\\n\\nI also know some others who do a lot of wildlife photography, but who pay their bills with jobs in the corporate world.\\n\\nSo your salary may not come from Wildlife photography - but rather other things (maybe wedding photography, teaching photography, stock photo licensing etc.).\\n\\nDont ignore computer science - it is a field that changes fast. Comp. sc may be something you can fall back on to make money (freelancing or a job itself)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nP.S: Talk to photographers, talk to studios, freelancers etc. Get some insight into the profession!'], ['Pahalgam, Kashmir, India.

That's almost 3 crores if you take the exchange rate to be 80 (which it will reach soon). You might get a chance to work in the US, or apply for a masters/PhD there. If you can afford the fees, that might be a good option. But remember that the average pay would be close to $60k in hand ($100k gross), which means that the payback will run into a decade, unless you manage to increase your salary substantially. Also, you never know what the visa situation will be like. \\n\\n  \\nCS at an NIT is also a good option. Much cheaper, and has a lot of brand recognition. \\n\\nCall me biased, but the best professionals I have interacted with have studied at an IIT- especially the older ones (Kharagpur, Delhi, Mumbai, Kanpur and Guwahati). **I'm not an IITan so don't make troll posts stating that I'm being elitist.**\\n\\nI have done a PhD from a top university abroad, and even here, if you have a degree from an IIT, it really makes the bored professor smile in appreciation. The advantage of an IIT is that it has the best peer group you can get at your age. And these are the folks who usually get the top spots at graduate programs abroad. You may not get computer science, but you can try getting a minor in the subject and seek a job that's into any field of applied engineering. \\n\\nA lot of people will tell you that IITs are hyped and low in ranking etc. Please understand that rankings are based on research output, the number of international students and professors etc. They are not based on student quality or jobs they get after graduation. Rich universities game the system, while those in developing countries like India suffer. \\n\\nAll in all, it is a good dilemma to have. Personally, I find it risky to spend 3 crores on an undergraduate degree. If you want to go to the US or EU or some other country, get a masters or a PhD from there after doing your UG from here. CMU. Hands down. \\nGreat school. You'll have a great experience. \\nHowever, the program is intense. So just fyi. \\n\\nP.S: I got into BIT after 12th then dropped out after 2 semesters.

As stated by experts the payback period is longer but you'll know to tackle the top level problems. Your approach towards engineering problems will be much better when you join the industry.\\n\\n If you want to do more of traditional engineering and bag high package placements go to IITs.\\n\\nGood Luck. Academics wise, I would say it really shouldn't make much of a difference for your UG degree. But the extra curricular activities, clubs, societies that any Western university provides are the real game changer. You'll slog in IIT and CMU, but at the end, you'll have accomplished more in CMU than in IIT.\\n\\nThe biggest issue with studying abroad is the expense, especially when it comes to USA. But if you get a scholarship, that should ease a lot of the burden. Carnegie Mellon any day, especially if you want to pursue AI/ML. The environmental exposure and peer group will be outstanding, some of the greatest minds across the world.  You kind of get this at IITs too but most students generally tend to slack off until they reach their penultimate years of Undergrad.\\n\\nIt's a great ROI if you can afford it. If you do well and play your cards right at CMU it won't be hard getting into top companies like FAANG or start-ups with high pay grade. Totally worth it over considering MS at CMU after IIT undergrad. Applying to Masters even through an IIT is very hard to get accepted, it will need a lot of effort on your side in terms of extra-curricular and research work.\\n\\nP.s: I'm an IIT undergrad currently developing my profile and aspiring to get into MS ML at CMU. Carnegie Mellon Since most of the iitians and nitians end up going abroad, I would say skip that step Completely dependends on what are your goals and ambitions but anyday CMU>>IIT's CMU ranks 1^st in the world for its computer science program. Since, most of the IITians try their hard to get CMU for their MS, you are basically getting a head start. Also, you'll not need require MS to immigrate as you'll already be in the USA for 4 years. Also, the best thing is you'll grow so much as a person during the 4 years. \\n\\nCMU is costly, that's a fact.

Even if the research papers are published in local languages (e.g. - Hindi), the terms that are used are so technical that a common person cannot understand it properly, even barely.\\n\\nResearch Papers are meant to be read by other researchers in the field (not common people) so that they can know what the author has done, and the findings have to be accepted by the entire scientific community around the world which has English as its common language.\\n\\nFor common people, what we need to do right now is **Science Communication** in their local languages. That means we must tell about our research to the people around us in their local languages. And every researcher should consider Science Communication as their duty to make people aware of the advancements in Science. **Only then will it be beneficial to the society**. (Publishing papers in local languages but doing no Science Communication is useless). No , it\\'s not done in local languages and discouraged  . Indian govt . have discouraged use of indian languages for business purpose and we have to learn english to get a job here except for extremely unskilled jobs. This is going on since independence . Presently in india only 10 % can speak English or understand english and only 2% are fluent in it . Source wikipedia . Hindi is the largest spoken languages more then 40 % ,. Even though india have almost 30 languages , the top 5 constitute 80% of India\\'s population not to mention these people are fluent in these languages despite this a population of 1.2 billion is forced to learn english . I will not talk about the cultural implication it is having and even the subreddit of india does not allow discussion and posting in indian languages , this is just a reflection of the mentality of indians . In india people have to learn english to get educated because no one bothers to translate the information . The numbers show why  it would make sense to publish your research or anything in indian languages in india instead of english but people will complain here that oh india have thousands of languages which is bullshit . Also all indian languages are very similar to each other hence much easier to learn compared to english for us . But india is  like a cultural hegemony , an independent country in form but not in substance . Ah I see. Well thank you for the thoughtful answer. I figured as much that much research is done in English - or at least there’s some version in English to contribute to the global community so that everyone understands.\\n\\nLike a Chinese and Japanese paper might be written in their characters, or the reports in characters, but ultimately I’m sure they’ll make a report in English, huh?\\n\\nI guess I’m just struggling with helping and teaching the younger generation on how to conduct sound research when they can barely write essays and synthesise ideas in English.\\n\\nI guess it’s ultimately up to the education system.\\n\\n—-\\n\\nMay I ask, how do Indians view people who speak or write good English? \\n\\nIn the Philippines, people sometimes say that a person is “sosyal” meaning like someone is snooty or an elite person that’s not good enough to speak the local languages. Ah wow this is the perfect answer I think. Thank you! \\n\\nI had forgotten about Science Communication.\\n\\nI am even following a new Filipino page because I was happy that they are doing science communication right and the author has a Master’s in it.\\n\\nOne of her papers was on the fact that the Philippines rarely has any helpful science communication entities in the news, media, papers.\\n\\n—-\\n\\nDo you think that India does science communication right? (At least in your region?)\\n\\nWhat do you wish could be done to help with science literacy, if there are problems?\\n\\nI recently enjoyed looking at a website called “Pratham Books” that translates all types of childrens’ books for Indians in different languages (because it’s open source). I wish we had that for the Philippines. There was one book that I love that helps kids understand simple machines. Oh wow, thank you for the great response.\\n\\nI would not mind talking about the cultural implications.\\n\\nAnd it is kind of sad that speaking local languages is discouraged, even on reddit.\\n\\nI moderate a subreddit for a Philippine region and I try my best to speak in a common language. I think it helps people to understand more and be more open. (Though there are obviously some words that are difficult to explain).\\n\\nBut I can see why moderators might want that - to better help everyone interact and easier to moderate comment.\\n\\n—- \\n\\nAnd see how you mentioned that research should also be published in local? I think that’s important here too. Not everyone is a master of English. And studies done within a certain country - those citizens might need that study the most.\\n\\nIt is a very difficult problem that multi-language countries face. Not OC\\n\\nI don\\'t know about the rural areas but at least in cities people don\\'t give much thought about your English. Mostly even the highly educated ones speak the local language outside of formal places. People are just more comfortable speaking the local language.\\n\\nBut yeah, if there is someone who only speaks English then of course there will be some speculation as it is very rare ( I have met only one person who speaks English outside of school). \\n\\nAlso the standard of \\'good English\\' for Indians is quite low as children are mostly told to focus on math and science and thus the children don\\'t even care about their mother tongue, forget English.\\n\\nSource : A student in Mumbai. Elders speak decently in both languages (mother tongue and English and sometimes even a third language), most students speak neither language properly. India has the biggest English speaking population in the world. It’s virtually impossible to go through our education system and reach a point where you’re publishing in scientific journals if you can’t write english properly. \\n\\nI should not generalize of course, but all my friends who publish speak English as if it was their first language.\\n\\nEdit: interesting point about “soysal”. We have a similar mentality in India as well. English definitely is often seen as a class barrier. >In the Philippines, people sometimes say that a person is “sosyal” meaning like someone is snooty or an elite person\\n\\nwe call them \"Peter\" in my part of the country (down South), and that means exactly what you referred to - a person who only speaks in English and considers themselves too good to speak the local language About Science Communications in India, I can tell you that it is not up to the mark. A lot of improvement is needed. I mentioned above how Science Communication is a duty of the researchers. I don\\'t see researchers actively engaging in it. \\n\\nThere are Science Communication officers in various research institutes here, who are trying to do all they can. I recently read an interview of a Science Communication Officer, Siddharth Kankaria, at NCBS, Bengaluru. I quote him here: \\n\\n>\"...... I also create a lot of creative collaterals such as images, videos, and podcasts myself as well as work with designers and artists to get it done......... I run a journal club that discusses research in science communication because a lot of people in India think of science communication as communicating science to people or writing articles. But there is a lot of solid social science research on how to communicate science and how to convince people to listen to and fight pseudoscience. I also help in capacity-building in terms of training and help students to communicate their science better. For instance, I held a five-day workshop amongst other people where we taught different modules on science communication. We had introductory modules on SciComm, storytelling and narratives in SciComm as well as written, verbal and visual SciComm. We talked about how to write articles, make posters, give talks etc. I also help the members of the campus (students) in capacity-building skills for their future and they come to me and ask for tips/feedback.\" \\n\\nSo, there are people working here but a lot more efforts are still needed, especially from the researchers.'], ['Forget coronavirus, homoeopathy can’t cure anything.

Having lived and worked at both places, Bangalore any fucking day! Noida is cheaper, Noida might have family.

Also, less pollution, far better weather conditions, work environment, cosmopolitan structure etc. \\n\\nHowever if your family is near Delhi, Noida stay here as you are going to save more and can look after them Bangalore is pretty much the best city in India for an engineering job if you cannot find a decent job in your hometown.\\n\\n Traffic is screwed up, but if you live close to work, you can take care of that. It is expensive but there are ways to save if you want. \\n\\nWork life is screwed up too. I would choose Living close to your home over Bangalore any day if you have a decent job. Comparisons based on my limited experience across the two cities:\\n\\n* **Colleagues:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: *Generally* a very crass crowd, inconsiderate, boorish, non-diverse.  Office colleagues are combatant and passive-aggressive, constantly at each others' throats. This also extends beyond the workplace and applies to the general populace. Exceptions exist, but they are exceptions and are not the norm.\\n   * BLR: Generally a more refined, laid-back crowd, quite diverse. This also extends to the general populace, except auto-rickshaw drivers and drivers in general. Exceptions exist, but they are exceptions and are not the norm.  \\n\\n* **Jobs and Pay:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: Very less options for switching. Pay upwards of 30L is hard to find.\\n   * BLR: Can switch every 6 months if one wants to. Pay upwards of 30L is a piece of cake (after a certain yoe).  \\n\\n* **Housing & Rent:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: Lots of new apartments with great construction quality available at affordable rents. Impossible to find same brackets and similar value in Bangalore.\\n   * BLR: Quality housing is available but the inventory is smaller than N/G's, and it costs a bomb. I've found that a kick-ass, shiny Gurgaon 3BHK which goes for INR 25k per month is INR 40-50k (at least) in Bangalore, for a similar or shittier apartment.  \\n\\n* **Transport, Roads, Traffic:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: Better roads, better public transport, and even though traffic can get crazy, it's not as bad as Bangalore's.\\n   * BLR: Pathetic roads, brutal, never-ending congestion in places like Silk board, Varthur road, KR Puram flyover etc.  \\n\\n* **Food:**\\n   * Noida / Gurgaon: Great quality and variety of food. Tons of options, even in the sub <200 price bracket, there is great quality food available.\\n   * BLR: Not fit for human consumption, unless you are willing to shell out serious dough. I've found that quality food (beautifully prepared and true to the authentic cuisine, hygienic, perfect proportions and taste, generous quantity) begins above the INR 500 mark, sometimes more.\\n\\nI personally cared about peers (and thus office culture) and money a lot more, hence I prioritized 1 and 2 over everything else and worked towards fixing issues related to housing, traffic and food. Unless you get a 40-50 % increment, stick to Noida. How many years experience do you have ? \\n\\nBangalore definitely has better salary, more job options, etc. but has become extremely expensive to raise kids, run a big family, etc. Also the traffic is simply not worth all the extra money in my personal perspective. If you are looking for a short stint of 2-3 years as a bachelor it might work out, but you may not want to go out of Bangalore after that, however bad it is. The place has a magical quality like that, which is quite tough to get out of. Definitely Nodia. Because of the following reasons: \\n\\n- Better public transport (Delhi metro is world class and DTC buses are awesome. You can also go for e-ricks and autos are cheaper than Bangalore) \\n\\n- House rents are cheap, compared to Bangalore. And availability is awesome.\\n\\n- Winter in Delhi lasts from 2nd week of October to 1st week or April. That is 6 months of awesome, chilly weather. \\n\\n- Social life in Delhi pretty good and usually have more options than Bangalore.\\n\\n- Delhi has better access to green spaces and public parks. \\n\\nOn the contrary, here are some reasons I wouldn't go for Delhi/Noida: \\n\\n- Despite 6 months of chilly weather, the other 6 months can be quite hot. Loo winds in May and June will raise temps to 45 - 50 degrees. July to September will be humid as fuck. \\n\\n- Pollution. Nothing to say about this. Air quality suffers for 4 weeks in October and generally, it's pretty bad throughout the year. Bangalore is as cheap as Noida. I’ve lived in both places, culturally opposite for obvious reasons. Bangalore is good for a short 3-4 yrs stint. But not many options when switching jobs :(\\n\\nThere are way more companies in BLR than here.\\n\\nConsidering I make around 1.2 lac per month, would you still say so?\"], ['Is JIO blocking vpn and reddit ?', 31, 'fsv00m', Subreddit(display_name='india'), 'https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsv00m/is_jio_blocking_vpn_and_reddit/', 27, \"Since yesterday unable to open reddit via tethering.

Till now, none of these countries has an operational Aircraft Carrier (AC). Instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or ALS (Amphibious Landing Ships).\\n\\n[INS Vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)\\n\\nBut more than them, India feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 Aircraft Carriers (ACs). Currently, Indian Navy has a solo AC called INS Vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from Russia. By 2022, India will get its 2nd AC which is its own indigenous AC called INS Vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. Now since India has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 AC fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. \\n\\n[India's Indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)\\n\\nGuarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe Pakistan doesn’t have an AC of its own. Opposite to that, China currently has 2 ACs namely Laoning & Shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. With this, China’s power projection through it’s PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India. China is working on getting 2 more ACs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of IOC. Till date, IOC has been guarded by India Navy in coordination with Japanese & South Korean Navy. \\n\\n[PLA Navy AC Shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)\\n\\nIndian Navy’s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of PLA Navy & to effectively guard the IOC region, it needs a 3rd AC which if accepted by Govt. of India (GOI); will be India’s 2nd indigenous AC called INS Vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. Due to this reason, GOI is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd AC for Indian Navy.\\n\\n[India-Australia Navy Officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)\\n\\nBut there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an AC jointly by 4 nations namely India, Australia, Japan & South Korea. Indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. This will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. I am hereby sharing the following points about it:-It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.\\n\\n1. Having a joint AC will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. \\n\\n2. It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.\\n\\n3. Each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as Japan for its electrical & electronic parts, Australia and South Korea for their weapon packages & crew and India for its expertise in hull & designing. \\n\\n4. Since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best AC built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. \\n\\n5. A huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. \\n\\n6. Joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 South Asian countries. That will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. \\n\\n7. Automatic threat-neutralisation from China’s PLA Navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint AC as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. \\n\\n  \\n\\n[F-35 B taking off from US Aircraft Carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)\\n\\nOne point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. Now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as Lockheed Martin’s F-35Bs or the 4+ generation Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Now except India, all 3 countries have already ordered F-35As for their airforce’ modernization plans. So they can easily get the F-35Bs which have been specially designed to be operated from ACs. \\n\\nBut again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint AC which in-turn won’t be feasible. Add to it, while the other 3 countries are also NATO members, US won’t be willing to allow access of F-35Bs with Indian navy officers & sailors on the AC as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of F-35Bs, which they might share with IAF, DRDO & HAL to help them make their own 5th generation AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft). \\n\\n[F\\\\/A-18 Super Hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)\\n\\nOn the other hand, opting for F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. The US won’t mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to Indian Navy and Indian Airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. Indian Navy’s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of Super Hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts. \\n\\n[JSDF \\\\(Japan\\\\) Navy Ships during Malabar Exercise with India.](https://preview.redd.it/nfgdxqrhftq41.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1db24b91d1148a6ea32964162d21cd14b4c83df3)\\n\\nNow it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the Chinese threat in IOC. It is only a matter of time coz once if PLA Navy gets its 3rd AC possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. But if India, Japan, Australia and South Korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint AC & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then China would think twice before messing with it.\", 1586041454.0, 'Science/Technology', 'Japan is under US military umbrella, not to mention that US has bases in all these countries..they don\\'t need us. US Seventh Fleet operates out of Japan. Japan has large \"helicopter carriers\" which I\\'m sure can embark the STOL version of the F-35. \\n\\nSouth Korea comes under the US umbrella and can ask for protection at any time should they require it. \\n\\nAustralia also has a couple of Helo carriers they can embark the F-35 on. \\n\\nAll in all, the ultimate way to beat a Chinese naval force in those waters is not with the brute force if an aircraft carrier but with multiple sea denial actions wherein the Chinese carriers are not allowed to operate freely. \\n\\nFor example, patrolling the strait of Malacca effectivepy can quickly put an end to any ambition of putting Chinese carriers in the Indian Ocean. Which is why the base in the Andamans is insanely important. Also, many countries in that region are not that close to China. Should there be any aggression, you can almost guarantee support because they\\'re also in the line of fire. Don\\'t you think we need hospitals and schools/ colleges more than we need aircraft carriers? The military might of USA didn\\'t protect their population from unemployment, poverty or a dangerously stupid president elected by an illiterate & brainwashed voter base. Just consider onething: Our navy doesn\\'t need more than 3 carriers at all. 1 for east, 1 for west, and one of the three is always at maintenance. Carriers just don\\'t justify the cost that they incur. Carriers are good for offence, but what we are looking for is defence. If our carriers are anyways going to stay near our coasts during defence then why not launch plames from the coast itself. America won\\'t less India F-35\\'s.\\n\\nIndia has bigger issues. Agreed. But if they are planning to convert their heli-carriers to aircraft carriers then it means that they got the required permission from U.S. to do so. And the biggest of those Heli-carriers is just 27,000 tonne. Not enough when your enemy has a 50,000 tonne aircraft carrier that is well-guarded by a group of other ships. A proper AC with strike group is much needed. And what better than having a joint one to reduce its construction & operating cost to 1/4th? I can confirm this (have multiple relatives in Navy and some of them actually served on the ACs) The largest Heli-carrier owned by Japan is of 27,000 tonne. And Australia doesn\\'t have heli-carriers. It has 2 HLS (Helicopter Landing Ships) which are weighed at 24,000 & 27,000 tonnes respectively. An aircraft carrier comes well-equipped with anti-aircraft & anti-submarine missiles along with powerful radars of different bandwidths. Also, an aircraft carrier is well-guarded by a fleet of ships which accompany it. Those things are missing in a heli-carrier. \\n\\nReasons why are wrote about operating a joint Aircraft Carriers are 3 important ones-\\n\\n1. US needs 2.5 billion extra to continue to patrol maritime areas in & around South China sea. Going by current damage caused by Cornona virus, they might fail to do so.\\n2. Indian Navy wishes to have a 3rd aircraft carrier which isn\\'t possible with limited funds as it also needs a number of submarines, new fighters, helicopters, etc. \\n3. All those nations that I mentioned are facing threat from Chinese Navy and operating an Aircraft Carrier on their own will be a costly affair after threat from Covid-19 ends. So having a joint one will reduce cost to 1/4th. It will also improve international relations with India and inter-operability. Then maybe they should have used the money for the statue to do some r&d for defence? The thing is we have funds but they are very misplaced. Health education: high priority, gets low funds, military:medium to high priority, get poor funds (believe me, our military is not adequate for a two front defence), statue: gaand jaisi priority, gaandphadu funds. Brother, U.S. has more than enough hospitals, schools, colleges needed. What\\'s needed is vaccine for Covid-19 & other life-threatening diseases; and research & development to setup new industries. BTW, didn\\'t mention that U.S. partnership is needed in raising & operating a joint AC.

One which especially damages the integrity of the coral structures accelerates beach erosion by compromising the lagoons?\\n\\n>Lakshadweep's indigenous industries are in a downward spiral as coconut trees are destroyed by more frequent storms and fisheries are wiped out by Coral bleaching. 90% of Lakshadweep's reefs died in 1998.

The article clearly outlines how building villas will accelerate energy and water crises, reduce access of local industries to the beaches and lagoons, threaten indigenous turtle species etc? If the locals are suffering and they need jobs I think we can agree that partaking in actions which further diminish local industries and stress resources are not in the best interest of locals. Even if these villas give locals some jobs it's clearly visible it'll jeopardise many more jobs in the process. Again, what are the locals getting from this? And why is a multi-crore tourism villa project in their best interest?How is it the only way to help them, when it appears that it's not really much help to therm in the first place.

Just turn on WiFi Calling, it makes your calls go over your broadband connection. It's crystal clear.\\n\\nProvided your phone supports VoWiFi and your Network has that service in your region. Very stupid advice tbh. VoLTE is very vital in this current environment especially for Airtel and Vodafone. This is why:- \\n\\n1. CSFB is a very slow and resource wasteful technology. The phone needs to switch to an available 3G or 2G network whenever a call has to be made or received. \\n2. Both Airtel and Vodafone are switching off their 3G networks in phases resulting in even longer connect times when circuit switching to 2G GSM network. \\n3. VoLTE does effect your call quality. The codecs used for VoLTE to VoLTE transmission is of 12-14kbps which is higher than your traditional call bit rate. \\n4. CSFB works optimal when the legacy networks are using lower frequency than the LTE network. This is now not the case as Airtel and Vodafone are refarming their 900MHz bandwidth for LTE and shifting 2G communications to 1800MHz.\\n\\nIf you are facing issues with VoLTE then you should open a ticket with your operator. Speaking from experience. WiFi calling does the exact opposite for me. Can't hear a single thing on wifi call. Does jio support wifi calling. It's not a stupid advice if it's working in the current situations. With regards to booking a ticket—I'm not the only one facing this issue, many people I know are facing it.

Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days.

Here is the press conference on Youtube and the final report of the commission as PDF after they visited Beijing, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Here are some interesting facts about Covid that I have not yet read in the media:\\n\\nWhen a cluster of several infected people occurred in China, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. Transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. Most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.\\n\\n5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. The duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). The mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in Wuhan many times over. The province of Hubei, whose capital is Wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. A total of 40,000 employees were sent to Hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in Wuhan are caring for Covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. Two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.\\n\\nChina can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. The test delivers a result on the same day. Across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: In Guangdong province, far from Wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.\\n\\nThe vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. Cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.\\n\\nThe most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.\\n\\nAn examination of 44,672 infected people in China showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. Fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. All fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in China up to 17 February, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.\\n\\nHealthcare system: 20% of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response, the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago.\\n\\nPre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.\\n\\nAge: The younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:\\n\\ntable placeholder \\n\\nRead: Of those infected in China, 8.1% were between 20 and 29 years old (this does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected). Of those infected in this age group, 0.2% died.\\n\\nGender: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.\\n\\nThe new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. Therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.\\n\\nSince the end of January, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in China has been steadily declining (shown here as a graph) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. \"This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real,\" the report says. The authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of Chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. Here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment.\\n\\nOne of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that China is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. There are 1,800 teams in Wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. But the effort outside of Wuhan is also big. In Shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. In Sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. In the province of Guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. That means: If you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.\\n\\nFinally, a few direct quotes from the report:\\n\\n\"China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. China’s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. This rather unique and unprecedented public health response in China reversed the escalating cases in both Hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.\"\\n\\n\"Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China. These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.\"\\n\\n\"COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.\"', 1583113763.0, 'Science/Technology', \"I recently read that the hospital treating these patients in Wuhan had around 20 ECMO machines and many more ventilators. ECMO machines are like super advanced and super expensive. There may be less than 100 in all of India. Most govt hospitals face shortage of ventilators too (which is inferior to ECMO). India cannot manage those critically ill with this disease at all. If it hits India or Bangladesh the economies will take such a hit and the cost to human life will be in the tens of thousands if not millions.\\n\\nI hope the concerned authorities are doing everything they can to stop it from spreading in India. I may be optimistic here, but this virus has not spread (local spread, not people who have traveled from China and Europe) in warm weather countries and Southern Hemisphere. I don't want to jinx it, but viruses usually die, or have shorter lifespans when exposed to higher temperatures. Also, clusters in Southern Spain and South Italy (that have warmer climate at this time of the year) are smaller than near the Alps, Korea and China. I feel there are more cases of Coronavirus in India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and Philippines than what we know but it is either spreading very slowly or not spreading due to the temperatures. I was planning a trip to Himachal Pradesh between March 7 and 14. Does this mean that I should not? The main reason for lab testing patients with just fever is to detect the mildly infected and their contacts and isolate and quarantine them respectively thereby slowing the infection rate.\\n\\nThis I hear is to spread the infected over time curve’s peak over as large a time period as possible so that hospitals can handle the load of severe and critical patients without running out of resources like ventilators and doctors. If the peak is over a very short time period then severe and critical patients will flood the system leading to a high cfr not just for covid but also for other diseases whose patients will have to share the high hospital load with the covid patients.\\n\\nIt is like with aggressive testing and quarantining they are pausing/slowing the infection while they deal with critical cases and empty the beds for new patients.\\n\\nThis manner of aggressive testing of all pneumonia patients with no travel history is about to start in the USA. It seems only patients with a travel history are being tested in India?? We are already fucked \\U0001f91f ...

Damn! These south Indians always get the good things! /s This inequality will happen when we have a free market economy, but no social democracy. Like in the USA, and now India, which emulates them. \\n\\nUnless a country offers free world class education and healthcare, this gap will only increase. Most European countries that offer these don’t have such a yawning gap between the rich and poor. Tax money is used to give free education and healthcare of a very high degree of quality. \\n\\nWhen free quality education is lacking, opportunities to the poor are denied because the rich will send their children to the good schools, and will obviously have a head start over their poor counterparts for quality jobs. And the rich-poor gap will only increase. But if the poor were to receive the same (and free) quality education, they will be able to compete on a equal footing, and this gap will slowly reduce. \\n\\nHealthcare is a major financial burden when people get seriously ill. The rich have access to the best healthcare, and they can afford it. The not-so-well off will see a major chunk of their savings shaved off if they fall seriously ill. Only a free quality healthcare system will allow them to not worry about this expense head. But as things stand today, here too we are copying the USA system of healthcare (one of the worst in the western world), where the insurance companies make all the money, and yet this is denied to the poor. \\n\\nOur tax money needs to go into these two heads if the country’s rich-poor divide is to reduce. Else the situation will get progressively worse, something that we are currently witnessing. \\n\\nBut our political class does not have such a vision. So it’s all a pipe dream. The even bigger concern when we see only 3~4% of Indians pay taxes. Even though I assume the bottom 50% are tax exempted as their income is very less. The rest 50% should not be tax exempted. Government has always sided with the rich: the reason is two-folded - One, this way the top 10% support the government which in turn causes a huge influence base and Second, once the top 10% support, they are willing to shell some money to the parties as well which is also beneficial for them. Solution would be track every transaction so that black money and bribery can be removed. That way, wealth can be accurately measured.

We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand.

It often occurs when a large number of people watch the same TV programmes while taking advantage of breaks in programming to use toilets and operate electrical appliances, thus causing large synchronised surges in national electricity consumption. Electricity networks devote considerable resources to predicting and providing electricity supply for these events, which in the UK, for example, typically impose an extra demand of around 200–400 megawatts (MW) on the National Grid. Short-term supply is often obtained from pumped storage reservoirs, which can be quickly brought online, backed up by the slower fossil fuel and nuclear power stations. The largest ever pickup was on 4 July 1990, when a 2800 MW demand was imposed by the ending of the penalty shootout in the England v West Germany FIFA World Cup semi-final.[1][2] In addition to pickups, the Grid also prepares for synchronised switch-offs during remembrance and energy-awareness events.\"'], ['COVID-19: Man posts ‘no ventilators in Ludhiana’ on Facebook, booked for sedition', 1692, 'fvsrd0', Subreddit(display_name='india'), 'https://indianexpress.com/article/india/covid-19-man-posts-no-ventilators-in-ludhiana-on-social-media-booked-for-sedition-6348963/', 188, '', 1586179071.0, 'Politics', '>In its official FIR briefing, Ludhiana police said that the man had been booked because he ‘created panic, tried to mislead administration during lockdown, and attempted to create a feeling of hate among common people towards the government.’ It\\'s hard to believe that there are no ventilators in Ludhiana.

His tweet was shared by few prominent people. There is a context to this pushback. This has been building up for a while and it isn't just a sudden outburst by the gulf public figures. Since 2014-15 the vilification of Muslims in India has ramped up a notch every few months. BJP/RSS hate for muslims is an open secret in the world and the only reason the Gulf countries never paid attention before when a riot broke out or a skirmish broke out between India and Pakistan was because the root of the conflicts were always cultural/political more than religious. A country oppressing minorities is routine, dare I say, banal but when the vilification of the minorities goes from being a result of usual cultural/political differences to the Sangh Parivar's open calls for Islamophobia, it raises the eyebrows of many Islamic countries. Also, social media has given the citizens of those countries a direct peep into our country and it's fucked up agenda to isolate and target muslims in broad daylight. \\n\\nThe same sanghis who go and behave like spineless servants in Gulf countries and lick the asses of their arab employers till their tongues turn brown go and rant about Muslims and more recently Islam online. It isn't some nuanced or polite criticism of Islam that they could tolerate but the absolute trash and hate filled comments against muslims and Islam that is been seen by the citizens of the Gulf. They are realizing that they are feeding baby snakes in their own country who go on to bite them. If the roles were reversed, we would be doing the same as them. I think more violently. We would be killing expats on the roads if they said the same thing about Hindus and Hinduism in the manner sanghis do online. \\n\\nThere is a crisis in our hand. Modi better keep his dogs in check or else we'll have a problem that we really don't want to have. Just curious, if these guys said also something regarding china's treatment of uyghurs? I dont think the monarchs give a shit about this or whats happening in India.

It also called for communities to be prepared for such measures through **periodic exercises**.\\n\\n> “All the practices and training schedules will be coupled with **mock exercises** followed by documentation and evaluation of lessons learnt to improve the existing system,” the report states.\\n\\n----\\n\\nIt\\'s not like govts and other bureaucrats don\\'t listen.

We’re paying the price for that”.\\n\\n----\\n\\nIt\\'s true that we are not prepared. I hope that we will work on it post Covid19. But, giving up control to NDRF which may think like a police force (i.e. in terms of control, order, etc), I think, is a bad idea. A better model, according to me, is to let a democratic body have the control and work with public and private healthcare, NDRF, experts and other involved parties, to be prepared for future epidemics or pandemics.

Debt to fuel productivity e.g. a loan to buy a truck that increases your productivity, making it easier to transport things in turn increasing your income, making it easier to repay.\\n2. Debt to fuel overspending e.g. a loan to buy TVs, ACs and everything else that you cannot afford, this debt doesn't increase productivity or income and just consumes it.\\n\\nIf you're undertaking first kind of debt, your future self will feel it easier to repay since his income would have increased because of this debt, but in case of the second kind of debt, your future self will not get any ease in repaying since his income haven't changed because of the undertaken debt. **And therefore the premise, not all debt is bad, just the once that don't increase productivity are.**\\n\\nHumans being humans are always susceptible to corruption, if I have $100, I might go get a book on cybersecurity OR I might go to an IMAX movie show.

Disclaimer to any fellow Muslims who read this comment- take your time out to evaluate how our faith should coexist peacefully in the 21st century. \\nRadical Islam is a disgusting, degenerate thing and it achieves nothing, especially against Sikhs and the Sikh community who have time and again been one of the most accepting and peaceful people towards everyone. They don’t deserve this. Don't know why this post is being mass downvoted? You got to be a special kind of asshole to murder Sikhs, the community that goes above and beyond to support all disadvantaged people especially Muslims in India. That being said, there's got to be a way to clamp down on Wahabbi style Islamic teaching in India. It's also wishful thinking that most of these educated terrorists went to madrassas.

With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.\\n\\n>27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।\\n\\nAn order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister\\'s Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**\\n\\nWorkers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. \\n\\n>मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’\\n\\nMukesh Kumar says- \"The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o\\'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home.

Absolutely disgust business practices. If the airlines decline refund to the ticketholders, the ticketholders hence commoners will get screwed.\\n\\nIf they do refund, their revenue will get hit. Flls and Dlls will start block trading at the slightest hint of downturn towards unsustainable level. Its the retail investors who are once again commoners who will get screwed. In case, the company proceeds towards bankruptcy, the majority shareholder will just file it (if not already sold off) and get away with other leverages. The retail investors hence commoners will get screwed even bad.\\n\\nIn case, the govt. order other public companies for bailout, their revenues will get hit hence the retail stockholders of those companies will get screwed. Also those public companies in order to compensate will raise their service charges and other charges. And once again commoners will get screwed.\\n\\nIn case, the govt uses its own fund for bailout, in order to compensate for it they will up the taxes. So once again the commoners will get screwed.\\n\\nSo whatever means is possible to address the issue will result in commoners getting screwed. Capitalism is designed in this way only. We had a big upcoming trip for a family of 5 to Singapore and Malaysia.\\n\\nFor AirBnB (Accommodation), Singapore accommodation got refunded 100% to my bank account. Malaysia accommodation got refunded to AirBnB credits. That\\'s fine because they don\\'t have many restrictions, it\\'s a small amount, and I can use it until the end of 2021.\\n\\nFor flights, Singapore Airlines is processing my refund in full to my source of payment. However, Indigo is tricky. The travel is for May 9 from Malaysia to BLR. However, they are now offering a credit shell with a 50% deduction. Maybe they will later enhance it to 100% to credit shell.\\n\\nI don\\'t have a problem with a credit shell. The issue is, the amount will be split among all the people in the PNR. The same people have to travel. Why do they mandate that? Why can\\'t it be like a normal wallet if you are refusing to refund to the source?\\n\\nI am guessing that airlines are hoping that the same set of people cannot travel and they can guzzle the money. or, upsell costlier tickets later since we have to pay the fare difference. This is absolutely horrible service. We have 4 domestic tickets booked for May end and with this stupid rule where I cannot get refund, I stand to lose 26K. Honestly speaking you have to feel about the aviation industry too .. They all are suffering from serious cash crunch (because of the basic mode of these industries) .. I don\\'t know whether this will come under the ministry regarding to aviation, but if it does come, they should surely come on an agreement with the same I got the complete amount refunded in my Indigo account which I can use later. I think that\\'s fair to both me and the airline. It\\'s already happening. I booked del-blr for 2.5k now I\\'m stuck with credit shell with indigo and spice jet. Both of them are offering del-blr at 3.5k where as air Asia at 2.5k Brother I lost 30k worth (flight tickets + AirBnb) already for the planned travel to Mumbai.

Any doubts you can message me.\\n\\nIf you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .\\n\\nThe real thing now is – why we need to invest. It’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That’s called inflation.\\n\\nSo, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.\\n\\nSo, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.\\n\\nWe will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Share Market\\xa0–\\nI just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .\\n\\nJust search in google : reliance share price\\n\\nAt that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.\\n\\nCompany list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.\\n\\nThe broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.\\n\\nFor example zerodha, they are India’s largest share broker -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. \\n\\n\\n\\n2. Mutual Fund :\\nMutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.\\n\\nThey are of different types:\\n\\ni. Equity Mutual fund:\\n\\nEquity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.\\nThere are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.\\nA index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.\\n\\nIf someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.\\n\\nii. Debt fund:\\nDebt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.\\n\\niii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.\\n\\nFor a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.\\n\\nThere are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their\\xa0coin.zerodha.com\\xa0to trade mutual funds. It’s free and direct.\\nYou can sign up and use the app to buy. It’s easy.\\n\\nYou may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\xa0Insurance\\xa0:\\nInsurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:\\n\\ni. General insurance\\nGeneral insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like\\n\\nFirst party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid\\n\\nThird party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid\\nThese are compulsory in india.\\n\\nii. Life insurance\\n\\nLife insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.\\n\\na. Health Insurance:\\nHealth insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense\\n\\nb. Term Insurance:\\nTerm insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…\\n\\nBut only death benefit, else you won’t get money.\\n\\nc. Endowment Plans:\\n\\nIf you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.\\n\\nOr if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.\\n\\nYou get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.\\n\\nBasically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges .

There are multiple types of mutual funds - equity, hybrid, small cap, mid cap, mix cap, tax savings etc. Few things I have understood is that (pls feel free to correct me if I am wrong) before you choose to invest in a mutual fund, look at few things, \\n\\n1. The net assets (bigger the number, better it is, basically means a lot of ppl have put money into it, indicates that ppl trust it and is safe risk wise)\\n\\n2. Check how it has performed over a period of yrs - 3 yrs, 5yrs, 10 yrs etc. \\n\\n3. If you are young, suggestion is to invest in equity find more and less in debt/liquid fund. \\n\\n4. Look at the rating (go for 5 star), the companies that each fund invests money in (if you want to know more details) \\n\\n5. Diversify, don't put all your eggs in one basket. \\n\\n6. If you are putting in mutual funds, think of long term and not short term, the returns come to you only in long term. \\n\\n7. If you want a back up, have an equity fund to go with liquid fund (just like a lil savings account with higher interest rate than bank actually, unless the market is a total crap).\\n\\n8.

What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  \\n     \\nWhen you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is ₹20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ₹60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ₹1L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      \\n\\nCredit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ₹1L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ₹1,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, I'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.\", 1585903576.0, 'Business/Finance', \"I'm doing the exact opposite - getting some money from savings and quickly closing my credit card bills asap. I can pay debts now, no guarantee how the economy will look after 3 months. Is the moratorium automatically applied or do you need to choose it somewhere. Because I don't need a moratorium This its another master stroke by RBI to pull in funds if you have crossed the half way mark in your loan tern - then delaying the 3 months of EMI is a good thing. \\n\\nhowever, if you are in the first half of your loan term - it's not really worth the effort. What if you use the moratorium to keep some cash and once the situation improves pay it back as a bulk amount. So basically hold on to the cash now and pay it off in a few months.\\n\\nThe interest difference won't be too bad then right? [deleted] This is the only smart thing to do. If the economy remains the same in 6 months many might well need to take on loans then. If the options before a bank are you and a person who has availed a moratorium, guess who the bank would prefer lending to with a better rate. Moratoriums may not be reported to credit bureaus but people would be kidding themselves if they think banks won't keep or ask for records. Same bro. And accumulating some emergency fund.

While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. \\n\\nThis pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?\\n\\nBusinesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. \\n\\nRemarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. \\n\\nA critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**\\n\\nStudies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. \\n\\nReal Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.\\n\\n**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**\\n\\n1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.\\n\\n2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.\\n\\n3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   \\n (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.\\n\\n4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.\\n\\n5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.\\n\\nWhile the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: \\n\\n **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. \\n\\n**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.\\n\\n· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**\\n\\n· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.\\n\\n· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. \\n\\n· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.\\n\\n· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.\\n\\n· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own \\n\\n· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \\\\- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!\\n\\n· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \\\\- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \\\\- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!\\n\\n· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.\\n\\n· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.\\n\\n· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.\\n\\n· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.\\n\\n· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.\\n\\n**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**\\n\\nProbably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**\\n\\n1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.\\n\\n2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.\\n\\n3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.\\n\\n4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.\\n\\n5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.\\n\\n6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.\\n\\n7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** \\n\\n**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**\\n\\n\\\\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, \\n\\n\\\\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, \\n\\n\\\\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly \\n\\n\\\\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... \\n\\nSimply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process\\n\\n**The Bottom Line**\\n\\n**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**\\n\\nReal estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.\\n\\n**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**\\n\\nThoughts Compiled By : \\n\\nDheeraj Kochhar\\n\\nCapitor Ventures Pvt Ltd\\n\\nNavi Mumbai\\n\\nReferences : \\n\\nAnarock Report March 2020, Varsha Rathore, Zricks.com, Pic Credits: Google stories and newspapers\", 1586440394.0, 'Business/Finance', \"Okay.

How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. \\n\\nUnlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer.

Here is a representative news report: [\"Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis\", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)\\n\\nOf this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union\\'s contribution to the \"State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)\" and the rest is as a \"Revenue Deficit Grant\".\\n\\n**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn\\'t see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.\\n\\n**Deep Dive:**\\n\\nThe XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).\\n\\nThese new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 \\'National Disaster Response Fund\\' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for \"*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”\\n\\nThe NDRMF and SDRMF are for *\"local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*\" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.\\n\\n*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.\\n\\n*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.\\n\\n*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨\\u200d⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫\\n\\nSimilarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.\\n\\nSource: 15th Finance Commission Report 2020-21.

The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:\\n\\n* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)\\n* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)\\n* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)\\n* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)\\n* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)\\n* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES\\n* Donation drives from citizens and civil society', 1586098195.0, 'Policy/Economy', \"I would especially like to emphasize page 99 onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of SDRMF is given.

There were several speculations and baseless theories (eg- north-south discrimination) but none of the critical comments, in my knowledge, mentioned about the finance commission recommendations, which is the actual reason. None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.\\n\\nI think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination. You can give all the justification and 'due process' you want.

This is because Delhi is not a state.\\n\\nYes so Delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right? like NDRF or the PM relief fund. I'm sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with Delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco Leave all technicalities. Can someone tell me how is Delhi supposed to operate without this fund? Basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? Great post u/ringtring. Kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why Delhi was not allocated funds.\\n\\nEither Kejriwal does not know the reason (mentioned in the post) or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against AAP by the centre. Either way, he needs to get his facts right. Nice research with Finance commission recommendations.\\n\\nBut the recommendations of the FC is ADVISORY and hence NOT BINDING on the govt. . So nothing like constitutional obligations. \\n\\nAlso PM Cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away ... so I feel the ball is in Central govt. court now to get funds for Delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around.

Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF’s Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\nOn April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called, \\xa0“[***Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view)”. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *Aarogya Setu*.\\n\\nIFF’s working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government’s *Trace Together* application, MIT’s *Private Kit: Safe Paths* initiative, and *Aarogya Setu*.\\n\\n**What is Contact Tracing?**\\n\\nAccording to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.\\n\\nContact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).   \\n\\n\\nAs a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user’s device comes in contact with another user’s device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  \\n\\n\\n**What’s the Risk?**   \\n\\n\\nWith the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief, \\xa0most apps which are purported as ‘contact tracing’ technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.\\n\\nA lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between “snake oil” and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.\\n\\nSuch systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.\\n\\nIt may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.\\n\\n**How to prevent these risks?**\\n\\nSuch systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:\\n\\n1. The usage of these applications should be voluntary\\n2. All data should always be stored locally on people’s devices\\n3. This data must be encrypted\\n4. No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server\\n5. Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.\\n6. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is “voluntary” and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  \\n\\n\\nTherefore, we need to adhere to two principles:\\n\\n1. Strict limits \\xa0(in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and\\n2. Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way\\n\\n**Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zw655ssbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b\\n\\nConsider the following aspects.\\n\\n**Is this for disease control or for other purposes?**\\n\\nIn other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.\\n\\nIn India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *Aarogya Setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.\\n\\nTo protect people’s right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***Aarogya Setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.\\n\\n**Minimisation? What Minimisation?**\\n\\n1. Singapore monitors people’s interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and **then there’s India which uses both**.\\n2. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India’s Aarogya Setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zy6tp8hvbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ea4b8aca61a8e38ec771f8ad785c5211b2bf17\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnrv4i6wbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23f8c169d0699880af385910b6ee8b4799d23955\\n\\n**No Transparency leads to discretion**\\n\\nThe only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does *Aarogya Setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.\\n\\nSimilarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app’s Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.\\n\\n**No Accountability and No Auditability**\\n\\nThe Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government’s processes are compliant with the right to privacy.\\n\\nSecond, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people’s personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.\\n\\n**Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit**\\n\\nFinally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *Aarogya Setu* project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.\\n\\nFinally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people’s informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people’s informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.\\n\\n**Links to IFF’s COVID-19 Related Work**\\n\\n1.

Arogya Setu app supports Russian, Japanese and Mandarin, this is a global app, someone just changed the package name and application name to make it Indianized\\n3. Check the apk analysis for \"Arogya Sethu\" app [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0ql25/askindia\\\\_is\\\\_arogya\\\\_setu\\\\_built\\\\_by\\\\_whoworld/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0ql25/askindia_is_arogya_setu_built_by_whoworld/)\\n\\n\\\\#infosys I was part of a team building a contact tracing app that would have used Bluetooth low energy to detect contacts. The data would have stayed on the users device and if and when they got infected, only then it would be uploaded to the server. I believe same was done in the case of TrueTrace the Singapore governments app. But after arogya setu was lunched we stopped working on it with the belief that when there are more apps on the market, it will hamper the tracing rather than aiding to it. \\n\\nThat being said, only tracing Bluetooth contacts is enough for detecting possible infections. For figuring out places where people might have chances of infection, government can use the location history export from maps of a infected person or simply ask the infected person about the places they visited. By obtaining that list govt. could easily notify people about possible risk of infection to people who have visited these places during this time. This way there is no need of tracking the location of each individual app user and the data remains in users hand. \\n\\nBut as the govt app is out now, many team\\'s who were working on the same might have already dropped the work citing similar reasons. We also made a video about the drawback of GPS tracing. Let\\'s hope the policymakers listen and remove location tracking. I will rather die from corona than install an app made by this fascist govt. The app was developed with support from MakeMyTrip I think.\\n\\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau9MqmSi0g&feature=youtu.be)\\n\\n\\nIn the video the co-founder of MakeMyTrip explains that the app was developed in partnership with them and he also tries to explain the basic functionality and the privacy concerns behind using this app. Key points to take away:\\n\\n\\n1. Uses Bluetooth pinging to check for a close proximity to an actual patient provided he also had the app installed. So it\\'s only effective if most of the population has it installed.\\n\\n2. Uses GPS information to tell the user if he had been in a designated hot spot.\\n\\n3. Every mobile is assigned a UID and it keeps a record of all UIDs who were in within the Bluetooth range (~10m). If an UID is found positive later, then all the UIDs who have been in close proximity to the positive UID will get a notification.\\n\\n4. Makes contact tracing process much faster .\\n\\n5. Data is wiped off from the servers after 30 days at the moment. This is based on the ICMR directions but it something that can change as their directives change. \\n\\n6. **MakeMyTrip founder says, that you are free to delete the app and you should definitely delete the app once Covid-19 blows over**. I just dont understand the fuzz over this. Modi has just asked to download this app. If you dont register and remove all app permissions, THEN TECHNICALLY THEY CANT USE ANYTHING. Please correct me if I am wrong. So is it safe to say this app is a big no no? Can you please explain how this tech works, especially the Bluetooth tracing part? We would recommend going through the working paper from Page 59 onwards. But just to wrap this up quicker for you: \\n\\n1/ Deleting the app does not delete your data which is gathered at the back-end which is gathered in a centralised manner. \\n\\n2/ The statements in the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use do not help in meaningful ways since the code is not auditable and further there is no data protection authority to verify. Yes, our recommendation is not to install Aarogya Setu in it\\'s present form without an audit of it\\'s source code and legal protections as highlighted above. It puts people to risk. Bluetooth uses packets known as beacons. These beacons when not paired will send request signals and accepts response signals in the form of packets from the neighbouring devices. As each device has a unique Bluetooth Mac address the app will make a list of device which was in a range and will upload there and then (I guess).'], ['Oyo revenues drop by 60%; staff on 60-90 day leave.', 171, 'fzwd3j', Subreddit(display_name='india'), 'https://newsasiatoday.com/oyo-revenues-drop-by-60-staff-on-60-90-day-leave', 37, '', 1586725351.0, 'Policy/Economy', \"[deleted] I'm surprised it's only dropped 60%. scam company oyo was in trouble even before corona. lotsa managers had been laid off recently I read that they made abt 50 mn last year ..can they afford to pay salaries The hotel industry is going to be one of the worst affected by this.

This has been done to correct the inverted duty structure to promote domestic manufacturing of electronics. The components already attracted 18 % while the built units 12 %. This promoted imports rather than manufacturing. The worse part is that the income in India is almost 10 times less than the US. But the price of electronics is actually *higher* here by almost 1.3x.

We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India. \\xa0This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.\\n\\nWe devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing. \\xa0To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court’s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It\\'s possible if we try!\\n\\n## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off\\n\\nThe world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.\\n\\nHowever, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.\\n\\nRecognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.\\n\\n## Overview of the working paper\\n\\nThis [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.\\n\\nFollowing this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person’s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.\\n\\nFinally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, “.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.”\\n\\n## We have three primary objectives from this working paper\\n\\n*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.\\n\\n*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.\\n\\n*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don\\'t have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).\\n\\n## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?\\n\\nWe will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.\\n\\nThis working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.\\n\\n## Links to our Covid related work\\n\\n1.

Stay safe ✌🏽 One potential silver lining is if the govt works on ensuring that the job providers stay afloat till the end of this pandemic, one thing different about this economic crisis from something like the 2008 financial crisis is that most of those unemployed can potentially rejoin the workforce rather quickly once this is over. 1 in 4 of the labour force. Imagine the dependents too. > In absolute terms, that's about 370 million who are unemployed. Fuck. That's insane\\n\\nHow did you get to that number? Do you think our workforce includes all of our population? The real number is much, much less, as this unemployment number is only out of workforce. There are many housewives, children, rich people that do not need to be employed, retired people and people that cannot work due to medical reasons and etc that don't count in workforce. \\n\\nBut the % is still significant. I can only hope that it goes down when all this is under control.

He said that we don\\'t have that type of ammunition now. So most of our measures may not be enough and inflation may run wild India due to this. Whereas the French government is in a much stronger position economically, with support from the EU as a bonus. de Galhau alluded to it [in his speech last week](https://www.banque-france.fr/en/intervention/emergency-crisis-response-initial-thinking-post-crisis-environment), second paragraph from the bottom.\\n\\n>While monetary financing is prohibited by the European treaties, it would, for example, according to these theories, be possible to imagine the central bank creating money on a lasting basis to directly finance companies. In principle, nothing is excluded in intellectual debate. However, steps such as these could only be envisaged if there was a major “downside” risk for price stability. It would therefore be imperative to ensure that any such measures guide inflation towards its target. Indeed, the two pillars that must remain in place come what may during these exceptional circumstances are the **central bank’s mandate** – ensuring price stability – and its **independence** – particularly from fiscal authorities. Because these two pillars are set down in the Treaty, and, above all, because they are the foundation of our most precious asset: the confidence of European citizens in their currency.\\n\\nWhile there is no specific mention of ways and means, it certainly does not imply \"helicopter money\". [This interview (only in French, unfortunately)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etALyku2E_0) was a lot more candid, where de Galhau talks about assisting businesses, but mentions specifically that not all industries are hurting equally. Agriculture and Pharma sectors are fine, but Automobiles is not. If you consider the services sectors, IT, Software and Telecom is fine, but F&B and Hospitality is not.

How does this crisis affect them?\"  \\n\\ndeG: \"Our banks are strong, solid. In much better shape than 10 years ago during the Great Financial Crisis. This isn\\'t by random chance. Public banks have been well securitised, they have their own funds and reserves etc.  Therefore they\\'re on high alert, ready to swing into action to assist companies with guaranteed loans, cleared by the European Central Bank.

All in all a 33% or so drop, I\\'ll get you those numbers.\"\\n\\n**On debt:**\\n\\nHost: \"Household debt, it is a concern?\"\\n\\ndeG: \"National Public debt will increase, which is expected. However for example, both companies and the government bear the burden of social security and unemployment benefits. Part time or reduced labour is incentivised, unlike the US with 10million unemployed in a fortnight. France is the most generous in all of Europe in this aspect, and yes, our Social European model does work but burdens us with public debt. We will need some serious direction in our budget to be able to amortise this accrued national debt. As for corporate debt, that will evidently increase as well.

It\\'s not really abandoning, it\\'s just that everyone is stuck at home, no one\\'s going to a point-of-sale cash counter in a shop, and even when they do it\\'s less frequent and they\\'re buying fewer things.

We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. \\n\\n### Background\\n\\nOn 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India’s internet shutdown framework. \\xa0The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.\\n\\nThe government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   \\n\\n\\n### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications\\n\\nWe first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*\\n\\nNoting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   \\n\\n\\n### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs\\n\\nWe also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. \\n\\nWe recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.\\n\\n### Important Documents\\n\\n1.

With these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the Government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives. \\xa0\\n\\n# Dashboards and Chatbots for All\\n\\nWhile responding to the COVID 19 crisis, the Indian Government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. Take for instance, the Ministry of Health’s COVID 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. The Ministry of Health and MyGovIndia have also collaborated with WhatsApp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. Even private players like Apollo Hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing COVID 19 through a mobile app. However, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the Government is slowing down their internet speed to 2G which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.\\n\\n# Telemedicine for All\\n\\nThe difficulty in communicating through video on a 2G internet connection also means that doctors in Jammu and Kashmir cannot use telemedicine. During pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. Reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. However, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2G internet services.\\n\\nHealthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. The essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the Ministry of Home Affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown.

These allegations are further reaffirmed when the WHO chief went to Wuhan on the 13th of January 2020 and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the Corona Virus. The above events show Trump\\'s failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage.

The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.\\n\\nWe have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.\\n\\nWe believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.\\n\\nSubsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.\\n\\n### Latest Developments\\n\\nIn an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).\\n\\nAdditionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.\\n\\nOur concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\n\\n### What have we written?\\n\\nGiven these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.\\n\\nIFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.\\n\\n### Important Documents\\n\\n1.

Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard.

The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.\\n* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.\\n\\nSumming up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post.

Today is a win of our attitude and mindset that we witnessed Women's Cricket World Cup game. 20 years ago, it was next to impossible to believe in those era. They reached via long and hard way. My Congratulations to them with full respect. Username checks out. Saw the crowd in Melbourne today? Now imagine the same here in Indian grounds for women's match. Finding it hard to visualize? Yeah that's where the issues lie in. Agreed. We got off only on a poor start. We could never recover from the early blows. Australia dominated us from the get go.

Lot of balls outside off stump trying for a nick. Should have bowled much straighter and forced batsman to play.\\nWe brought the game close but probably 30-40runs short or needed to break that 7th wicket partnership a little earlier.\\n\\nOverall, there are atleast 3 players - jaiswal, tyagi, bishoi who have a lot of potential. why is cricket still a thing ? I used to love cricket when I was a kid then I grew up. I mentioned it, the U19 world cup. We were all out for 178 and then bowled 30 extras!!! Our batting was destroyed because we underestimated the Bangladeshis and probably did not even give them the time of day and ultimately that's why we lost. Same thing happened Vs NZ in the world cup last year, Vs Pak in the champions trophy SF, Vs WI in the SF of the WT20 2016 and Vs Sri Lanka in the Final of the WT20 2014.

Thanks for the information, I wasn't even aware of the U19 world cup going on. It's certainly not a good habit to lose so many important tournaments.\\n\\nI have noticed a trend in current generation cricketers, they are very arrogant and overconfident for some reason, Pandya, Pant and a few others are like that.

I can share a small story that might interest some of you  \\n\\nI come from a small town surrounded by many Adivashi colonies, During my schooling I was an active football player and I even played inter divisional football for the South Eastern Railways, That time I used to see some Adivashi folks joining us in training and were of the same age but much stronger core to us ( Credit to their hard work and natural diet ), Some of them used to drive a van or rickshaw for the whole day in that summer heat and then came to practice, We still had a hard time beating them, Heck when after 70 mins we looked drained they ran like arrows Over the time as we grew priorities for them changed , I leaned for most they had to earn in order to even put food on the table. I was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn't exactly go well with sports and Indian parents in our country, Our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there's only so much you can do, People like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don't get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. \\n\\nWe still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, Let alone the I League. Community Shield etc. ISL is only for a short period of time and tbf it's doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.\\n\\nI still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.\\n\\nEdit: retarded typos. A sight to see.. I’d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies. Football is slowly picking up pace in India.

A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.\\n\\nThe percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.\\n\\nThe burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.\\n\\nBroadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.\\n\\nHow fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.', 1579006550.0, 'Food', 'People in the Northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions \\n\\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzuKz1fuQg\\n\\nHowever, the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their ‘non-Indianess’ for in their logic such people could only be ‘Chinese’ If you want to see how Caste affects the perception of non-vegetarianism look no further than Tamil Nadu. The majority of the state is non-vegetarian. It has an incredibly developed Non-vegetarian cuisine. Ask anyone outside the south about the perception of Tamilians and its always vegetarian.

I want to hug everyone I\\'ve known in the outside world and if I meet people I\\'ve had a falling out with, I\\'ll hug them too. Our problems are nothing. I really hope everyone makes it.\\n2.

If I knew things would escalate so quickly, I really would have stocked up. The only stock I have right now is of smokes and chocolates.   \\nc) Samosa, and although Vada Pav makes me sick, I\\'m gonna eat that anyway. I miss it.  \\nd) Pizza, burgers, fries, even coca cola(I\\'m anti anything by that company but now I\\'m desperate for some junk food) you name it.  \\ne) Icecream!  \\nf) Shawarma. oh my god I miss this terribly. \\n3. Things I want to drink- I don\\'t really drink but when I do, I\\'m a spiced rum and coke person (thank you Cambodia) BUT that being said, I definitely am going to buy myself some beer.\\n4. Things I want to do- Go trekking! I believe nature will be so amazing this time with barely any pollution. \\n5. I also really want to go out on a long ride on my bike. Right now my bike trips are limited to buying smokes (which ends in 5 mins) and I definitely need to go out more.\\n6. Go for long walks, road trips, picnics, you name it. I\\'m not a \"religious institution\" person, but I\\'ll do that too.\\n7. Go watch any movie in a theater.\\n8. Ride a local train. I miss the crowds.\\n9. Probably you.

From the indus Valley time's  lothal port to trading with Africa, gujratis often travelled long distances during their travels.\\n\\nIn order to survive these journeys, they made large variety of dry snacks which won't spoil easily. This is the reason why gujrati diet has so many dry snacks as its part\", 1581982096.0, 'Food', 'But, by that logic shouldn\\'t odias also have dry snacks too..we were a seafaring people too with trade relations in the far East. Now this is just my theory, so take it with a pinch of salt. It\\'s based on my mother and my grandmother\\'s account of her childhood.\\n\\nBasically, Gujarat is semi arid region and water deficient in most parts. Pulses generally grow in such areas where irrigation is lacking and rain is scarce. Back in the days, most people consumed what grows in the region. Groundnut was another crop. So you see the diet dominant in these pulses and groundnut. Oil used is also the same while much of North India used sarson.. (which is non existent in Gujarat, btw). White rice seems a recent entrant on the plate. Earlier it used to be mostly red rice. (My mom says that they had to queue up with the ration shop when they come to know that white rice has arrived.) Most elders in my family used to eat jowar till 90s (in South Gujarat). In Saurashtra, it would be bajra. Again, wheat rotis become popular only recently. (May be post 70s). \\n\\nMy grandmother said that back in the days, they would get vegetables only during monsoon and winter. For most of the summer, they would only eat mangoes (which was in abundance in the season.) Sabji was just some pulses cooked into a curry like -dried chana, moong, besan etc. No green veggies for summer. So you see most of the gujju dishes have a base of pulses, because essentially that\\'s what was available. \\n\\nActually besan is a common ingredient across rajasthan, gujarat and Maharashtra - all historically water deficient states. The super fried snacks may be a recent addition. (I remember there were only 2-3 famous shops in my hometown in the 90s and most of the snack was bought and consumed garama-garam.. after 10 in the morning and 7 in the evening, you won\\'t get anything...it\\'s consumption may have increased with it being available in packets everywhere now.)  Also, they are not limited to Gujarat only. Even South has its variant of \"murukku\". The Gujarati or rather Central Indian snacks became more famous recently because of Haldiram maybe? Even the \"murmura\" snacks are common in much of India. \\n\\nBut yes, we do like to carry our food along while traveling. Though that has to do with our \"save money for 1 meal\" tendency plus \"won\\'t find vegetarian food\" problem. Don\\'t think it has much to do with the seafarers. They probably had an abundance of macchi from the Arabian sea on their way to Africa. This is the state of affairs. The OP posted a theory based on Geopolitics about Food and in no way claimed any superiority but barring few all comments are bashing the OP or Gujaratis. \\n\\nAbout the theory, quite plausible. It is often the case that even today Gujaratis travel with their own food in trains etc. This is an indicative of a culture which carries food with them, and the day snacks such as Farsan (not just Gujarati) are quite nutritious and energy rich for journeys. \\nBut that\\'s just my perspective, I am sure you will find some research about it.\\n\\nIf interested, by far the best Travel food I have found is HardTack or Ship Biscuit. It lasts years, museums have HardTack from the 1700s which is still edible. Plausible. I remember hearing something similar on Raja Rasoi show on Netflix. Don\\'t know man. There are so many preservatives like salt, which would have been abundant in Gujarat. While it is highly plausible that dry foods would be the norm for sea faring traders, we don\\'t see the same in the southern foods, who traded with Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and the eastern coast, who traded with the Chinese. It\\'s possible, but not conclusive. One I heard about Rajasthan is that their food is spicy because it make people to drink more water than usual, given the extreme hot weather Gujjus and their Besan. It\\'s the worst thing for nutrition values. No wonder the state has highest number of cases of under and malnutrition as compared to India. WHO always worries about that state\\'s health and nutrition since decades. But why unhealthy snacks? Do they have sweet snacks because excessive travelling led them to make constant sources of energy?\\n\\n\\nman,people will boast about breathing air theses days.'], ['Ice-cream dosa anyone?

How do you feel about the role of organisations like Teach For India that exist outside of the public education system but seek to supplement it?

A lot of the changes that have happened in Delhi seem to have involved adopting best practices from other countries and from the existing body of education research. How difficult has it been adapting what works outside the country to what works within the state?\\n\\n3. There aren\\'t too many centres focusing on education research in India outside of APU, JNU, and TISS (off the top of my head). How problematic is that to localising education research? \\n\\n4. Current books you\\'re reading that you\\'d recommend?\\n\\nCheers! Hi Atishi, welcome to Reddit\\n\\n1. A recent survey showed that 65% of government schools in Delhi are without principals. While the government says the matter is with the LG, how do we make sure children and their studies are not impacted?\\n\\n2. Delhi is a city notorious for its women safety issues. There are still a lot of boys-only and girls-only government schools in the city. What are your thoughts on such schools? Do you think the government can do more in enabling better, healthy relationship between both genders from a young age? Apologies first up, coz got too many queries\\n\\n1. Do you think there is a concerted effort to rewrite the history of our country? Do you think that the present uni dimensional nature of professional education is much to blame for the social dystopia whatsapp forwards have created by citing fake history, fake polity and even well educated people are falling prey to it?\\n\\n2. Do you think that the present governments stance of pushing privatisation of education, and pushing every institution to be self dependent will ultimately spell disaster for the middle class and lower class, who will fail to take up such courses?\\n\\n3. The Indian growth has been a curious case of jobless growth. What opinion do you have on the fact that although the private sector has boomed since 1991, we have failed to create sufficient jobs? In the same context, should the government be relieved of all responsibility regarding job creation, or do you believe the present govt just wants to shrug off its share of responsibility ?\\n\\n4. An economy without planning is more often a directionless economy. While NITI aayog was developed in the first place to allow pvt participation in govt decisions, it has now turned out to be a body of paid \"yes men\" who merely provide rubber stamp on what the govt believes.

How do you think we can realistically  achieve a more transparent campaign finance laws? Would it be fair to say that the present day India is same as the Gilded Age America? Do you think the Indian institutions (RBI, CAG, CVC, CBI, etc) are heavily influenced by political agents? If yes, what can be done to limit the political influence in administrative institutions?  Hi Milan, What is your opinion on bringing private sector talent in Bureaucracy considering conflict of interest, revolving door policy and nepotism.  Hi, what all books do you recommend as your favourites. About India, contemporary politics, world as well as fiction. I have read few chapters from When Crime Pays and found it really interesting, thank you.

I understand that each democracy is unique but is there an underlying commonality between these elections? Is this a new world order? Is this the last wave of populist nationalism before ideas such as egalitarianism become mainstream?  Hi Milan, welcome to /r/India. To what extent do you think,  think tanks affect policy making. In your experience, do bureaucrats stay updated with the latest literature?   Its a fatalistic/question out of desperation: will the system of politics, money laundering for elections, crime in politics... Will this ever change? (Deep down I think I know the answer and its not the happy one) What has the reaction to the book \"When Crime Pays\" been in India? Has anything changed since then? Does crime still pay in Indian politics? Are you able to go to India without risking being jailed or personally injured? Do you vote in Indian elections?

A formidable data protection law?\\n2. Making current Aadhaar Act more robust?\\n3. Ensuring the implementation of \\'voluntary enrolment\\' section of the act?\\n4. Doing away with the use of biometric?\\n5. Dismantling whole Aadhaar infrastructure?\\n6. Something else?\\n\\nEdit : This question has been ignored, despite being decently upvoted. Clarifying, that this is not a troll/rhetoric question. The question seeks to understand, what is the way forward. Each one of you can please reply individually. I have had the experience of living in a State where they had a dictatorship. The id card was a weapon used by the state to deny people their rights. If you didn\\'t have an id you did not exist. The State actively denied id to people of certain demographics who they knew were generally against the state. Then there were things like the police were authorised to stop anyone and demand an id, if you were unfortunate not to have one, you were at their mercy.\\n\\nMy question is, how far are we from such a reality?\\n\\nSecondly going by the Government\\'s arguments in court about owning personal biometrics, is it not possible that the government may in the future decide to include dna as an additional biometric?  Since many of us here have been following and opposing aadhaar from its very beginning , I think we are now at the cusp of its final road where it could go either way.. so my question in general is \\n\\n1.) If the judgement does in comes favor of the petitioners , and aadhaar is scarped , or limited , what would be the govt`s reaction ? can they make new pillars through parliament to strengthen it?\\n\\n2.) If the judgement comes in favor of govt , what should be our next course of action ? I for one and many here and on other forums havent enrolled for aadhaar , so should be our next move , still wait out or enroll after SC judgement?\\n\\nThanks in advance for your participation here on reddit . To the lawyers on the panel:\\n\\nIf there is proof that a citizen\\'s Aadhar number is leaked (by govt website or other means); can the citizen disown the Aadhar number like other IDs and names/surnames via the affidavit route? \\n\\ni.e. Can I file an affidavit that my Aadhar number so-and-so is leaked and not to be trusted for any further transaction. Put advt in two national papers and be done with it?\\n On a recent trip, I witnessed large scale collection of fingerprints in a temple premises for free food - the reason given was to prevent the same person availing the benefit multiple times for each slot. As far as I know, there are no laws in place that makes the fingerprint collection illegal.\\n\\nIf they were collecting raw fingerprint data, and UIDAI somehow had access to that, they could match that with the hashes they have, and illegally build a raw fingerprint database linked to people\\'s identities, which could be misused at scale with horrific consequences.\\n\\nIn all the discussions of Aadhaar related privacy issues I\\'ve seen so far, no one has raised the issue of private players collecting fingerprints from masses and selling it to corrupt officials at UIDAI, who could use the Aadhaar database to build a raw biometrics database that could be used to target citizens at will.\\n\\nWould you please raise this issue as well? Also, could you petition to stop the ongoing fingerprint collection at the temple? Unless I\\'m mistaken, it happens everyday, and it\\'s quite a popular temple.\\n\\nVideo of incident: https://streamable.com/i8l9t We live in a country of where more than half the population do not have permanent address. Aadhar does not allow us to change addresses easily? So, what shall I do, not move? If my house owner asks me to move shall I quote Aadhar as the reason for not shifting?\\n\\nWe live in a country where connectivity is at the best 50% or less reliable. The service provided by the telecom providers are so bad, that we need to have multiple phone numbers so that we can have a connected when necessity arises. So, what do I do? Should I put up with bad connectivity and bad customer service because I have recorded this phone against my Aadhar? Say, my mobile got stolen, what do I do? Because it is against my Aadhar, I have to go complain, get an FIR and make sure the telecom provider either disables and gives me another SIM with the same phone number? How do I prevent misuse of my phone now? So, basically while in the past I could have just said \"forget it\" it is just a loss of 10K, now I find myself in a position where it is a huge loss, waste of time and effort and making sure I prove that I did not do something wrong? Say I got another phone with a different number, how do I change my phone number? It is a myth that address and phone numbers on Aadhar can be changed. I know of people who are already struggling to do this!!!\\n\\nWe live in a country where more than half the population has to do manual labor to survive, which means finger prints do not get retained over a period of years that is what we are talking about, not just one year and two years!! We are talking over a life time. Over that period of time I get cuts over my finger, I get burns, things get smudged, I have accidents, fingerprints are bound to change. So, what shall I do? Are we suggesting I cannot live a carefree life because I have enrolled in Aadhar? I have to ensure my finger print stays, so another thing I ensure does not happen?\\n\\nWhat is the means of identifying a person at all? Address changes, phones change, fingerprints are non-reliable. DNA? So, how do we get a fast recognizing DNA machine? What is the reliable form of identification that can be automated in the real-time that is required here? None of these have been thought about!!! The environmental factors have not been considered to ensure over a period of 40+ years the same identity can be maintained and proved!!! Who has studied fingerprints to ensure nothing changes because of the heat or the dryness of the air, the pollution in the air? Yet, this is being linked to all my life savings, insurances, investments and so on everything that I have been doing to ensure a good retirement?\\n\\nSo, in the end, the way I see Aadhar: There will definitely come a time when I cannot prove my identity since all forms of identification used in Aadhar is not permanent, I would have linked all my life savings to this form of identification hence all my life work has been wasted and what really has happened is a person who had all the hacking skills was able to just breeze in and use my life savings to live a better life and I who tried to make life better got the worst end of it, because my government told me that all my hard work was worth nothing because I could not prove the 12 digit number that I am quoting belongs to me!!! Strange life!!! Thank you so much all for doing this AMA.\\n\\nI usually have a problem explaining to my friends why Aadhaar is big deal. The general mentality I\\'ve encountered is that it doesn\\'t matter and privacy is dead in the modern age anyway. Could you give a plausible negative scenario or two that I could use as an example to explain to them about why we should be concerned. Most people I\\'ve talked to don\\'t care about the leaks at all. If I could tell them how exactly it could affect us, that would help raise awareness at whatever level I can.\\n\\nThanks again for fighting the system on this and doing what you\\'re doing.

But with Rajeev Chandrashekhar, a strong BJP supporter and Rajya Sabha MP running the show, and Anupam Kher, another vocal BJP supporter whose wife is a BJP MP, being asssociated with the channel, how can you say that there won't be bias? And why was an article by The Wire highlighting the same taken down when you yourself advocate freedom of press?\\n\\n\\n2. You have talked about creating a media outlet with an Indian focus and a global audience, similar to the likes of BBC, CNN and RT. Do you aim to take Republic TV in that direction, or is it just a right-leaning news channel for local audience, a la Fox News? Whats so different about Republic news and why should I watch it?

Thanks again!!\", 1534192270.0, 'AMA', 'Hi, I\\'m excited to see you taking an AMA. I heard about your recent tapeout of Shakti cores. The second public tapeout of risc-v in the world. Congratulations!\\n\\nI have a few questions:\\n\\n1) I understand the stages of software design, but hardware is opaque. Can you give us a overview of the stages of processor design? What stages cost the most time? Which ones take the most manpower? \\n\\n1A) I remember reading that AMD Zen team spent 2 million man hours over 4 years to design the replacement to Excavator. Since I don\\'t understand much about hardware, how can a small group of entrepreneurs and academics hope to put up the enormous amount of effort needed to build and validate a processor design?\\n\\n2) Can you elaborate on your power, performance, area and especially security design goals for your server and desktop class processors? I\\'ve read your website but it only mentions features and clockrate of the processors. Compared to the best Intel server and desktop chips of 2018, what is your performance goal? 50% as good? 80%?\\n\\n2A) I\\'m not asking you to commit to delivering chips on any time frame, but once again, due to my ignorance of hardware, I don\\'t have any idea of how long your chip design efforts will take. To meet your design goals for servers and desktop as detailed in 2), how long do you estimate it will take your team to design these chips? 5 years? 10 years?\\n\\n3) I\\'m given to understand that the x86 processor family was not designed for security. The processor design grew organically over time, so it\\'s as full of holes as Swiss cheese. What systematic hardware and software design changes, if any, are you taking to avoid the security failures of x86, ARM and MIPS family?\\n\\n4) I\\'m concerned about the security of RISC-V chips. The chip design world is spending a lot of time and money to formally verify the risc-v ISA and creating chip designs, but they\\'re writing drivers and other hardware level software in C or C++, which has had almost 50 years to prove itself insecure. I understand that you will need to write code in C for Linux related matters, and I don\\'t expect that to change. However, have you considered using more secure languages like Rust for software that does not have to be in C/C++? \\n\\nI\\'m pointing this out because whatever language you use for your risc-v project is going to be in use 50 years from now. I really don\\'t want to be using insecure software in 2068. Have you given any thought to this? You have stated on your bitbucket-site that there will be six (or eight) versions of cores, I have seen progress on three of those. What is the timeline for the rest of the processors? \\n Another question: Have you guys considered a copyleft license for your project like Cern Open Hardware License? \\n\\nBSD-style licenses allow for one-way transfer of intellectual property, whereas copyleft licenses like COHL keep the pool of intellectual property in the public domain. \\n\\nUsing a permissive license like BSD will make it very easy for companies to take your design and make it proprietary, but its not the right license if you want to create a open hardware ecosystem. \\n\\nWhy would a company like Samsung take your design and put 250 million dollars of investment to take it to the next level of quality, if the BSD license allows Apple to show up, take the results of Samsung\\'s hard work and make it proprietary? \\n\\nBSD and Linux projects have been around for the same length of time, but while Linux has taken over the world, BSD is stagnant. Companies don\\'t use permissive licenses for software unless they control that stack and it\\'s not a core part of their business. Permissive licences create silos but an open hardware community needs a two-way, copyleft license. \\n\\nDue to the incentives your license creates, I expect companies and academics to take your work but not give anything back. An open hardware community based on your team\\'s work is all but impossible. Have you considered changing the Shakti project\\'s license?

This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.\\n\\nIf you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up.

Thank you for your awesome work, and of course, the AMA. We have a few questions\\nwhich probably stem from a limited understanding of law in general, and this proposed\\nbill in particular. \\n\\n## Definitions:\\n\\n1. Would you consider location data, call records, and behavioral data, as \\nconstituents of personal data? Are these covered under the proposed bill, or are\\nthese to be treated separately?\\n\\n2. Clause 2.1.b Is psedonymised data a permissible alternative for businesses to\\nclaim that they have suitably anonymised the data?\\n\\n3. Does the 2.1.h definition of _communication_ encompass keystrokes, screenshots\\nand other electronic signals that may enable creation of PII? Will back-channel\\nattacks to steal encryption keys be construed unlawful under the provision of this\\nbill?\\n\\n4. The GDPR definition of personal data [includes](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en):\\n      > Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the \\n      > identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.  \\n      \\n   Does the definition in 2.1.u personal data incorporate this aspect?\\n\\n\\n## Scope:\\n\\n1. How does the bill treat personal data of minors under 13? This is a lucrative\\nuser base for certain industries, and we have seen quite a few data breaches \\ninvolving children\\'s data.\\n\\n2. How will the current Lawful Intercept regime be impacted by such a bill? Will\\nthis lead towards the creation of special, FISA-like courts, with unfettered powers?\\n\\n3. Suppose civic volunteers create a database in the form of a spreadsheet to help \\ndistressed individuals during a natural calamity which they then forget to dispose off.\\nWill the proposed Privacy Commission act suo motu, to ensure safe disposal of such zombie data? \\n\\n4. The current interpretation of [public order](https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/free-speech-and-public-order-1)\\nrequires relevance, and mandates proportionate action, for greater good. However, we see \\nthe phrase \"public order\" has become [increasingly popular](https://imgur.com/a/6ta3xt9) in recent case records. Do you\\nforesee abuse of this provision in near future?\\n\\n5. While _ex post facto_ laws are notoriously difficult, Article 20 does not particularly\\nforbid such a law (Sujjan Singh v. State of Punjab). Do you see a parallel in businesses\\nwhich continue to profit from data collected at an earlier era and the corruption case?\\n\\n## Business Impact:\\n\\n1. Do you see the need for a transition period to allow businesses to incorporate\\nthe recommendations, and streamlining the proposed Privacy Commission\\'s processes?\\n\\n2. Per the provision of 5.1.3 an Airbnb host can install CCTV cameras which become\\na nightmare for a guest at a later time. How do you propose the bill deal with such\\ncases?\\n\\n3. Suppose the medical history of a comatose patient, suffering from a rare disease,\\nis of interest to researchers. Is it then the next-of-kin\\'s decision whether or not\\nto share the data? 8.3 discusses unsound mind, but not unsound health.\\n\\n4. Will such a bill thwart IP that hinges on sensitive data? See the recently filed\\n[Google patent](https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1032183690447806464).\\n\\n5. Do employers need informed consent before installing packet inspection software\\non devices provided to employees that are used off-premises? Also, how would you\\ntreat this [recent](https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1032543799258431488) case.\\n\\nEdit: Added graph on \"public order\" phrase frequency, 2008-2017; grammar\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\nThank you for doing this AMA for a community such as ours at r/india. You folks at the Internet Freedom Foundation have been doing some stellar work and it motivates me every day to do better for the society we live in. I have a few questions for all of you and I hope you can answer some if not all:\\n\\n1. What is your opinion on the recent case filed in Delhi High Court seeking damages from the UIDAI for the leak?\\n\\n2. Banks still insist on me submitting my Aadhar to open an account. Apart from not opening an account there what redressal so I have?\\n\\n3.Why do you think Google recently preinstalled the helpline number of UIDAI on all our cellphones?\\n\\n4. When does the grapevine expect the Aadhar judgment to be pronounced by the SC?\\n\\n5. Has there been a large data leak in India that the general public is not aware of?\\n\\n6. The appointments made to the Justice Srikrishna Committee on Data Privacy were said to be completely one sided favoring the corporates and datamarketeers. What do you feel we can do to make our voice more heard?\\n\\n7. Do you think sophisticated data theft by Indian corporates will become more easy in the coming years due to the onslaught of AI? It may be difficult for consumers such as I to get access to such a sophisticated software to stop them.\\n\\n8. Can we create an anonymous crowd sourced Privacy App (ACPA) to show us which developers sell our data and to what extent?\\n\\n9. Mumbai currently has CCTV cameras with facial recognition present everywhere. How are they protecting my data under the archaic IT Act? What are they doing with my data? Who has access to the footage and how can I secure it?\\n\\n10. Does Justice Srikrishna\\'s new Data Protection Bill have a clause for whistle blowers or ethical hackers such as Edward Snowden or will someone who does something similar be left for the dogs? Heya! You guys are doing something really really important, please keep doing the good work and thank you.\\n\\nMy question is most people don\\'t take privacy seriously, they just hand over any document they are asked for without even a single thought and this becomes even more worrisome in case of aadhar. I personally get in a agrument on weekly basis with people around me just for this.\\n\\nHow does one explain to them that this is dangerous and they shouldn\\'t share anything with anyone just \\'cause someone asks for it and especially not their aadhar number, what is the most logical and simplest agrument against not Sharing your information according to you.\\n\\nAnd again Thank You, really we the citizens are indebted to your fight and cause. Hey Gautam Sir! Following you since your gold record days at Bangalore!... Big fan of yours. \\n***\\n* Wish to know that how advisable is it to lock biometric details on the Aadhar website? \\n\\n* Also what is the case where non-government agencies ask for Aadhar details? Like banks or when couriers ask it for verification? Not giving them amounts to non-accessation of services so what\\'s the alternative?\\n\\n* Any provision for me to delete my aadhar details from the system or is it like lifetime liability which the govt. has handed us?\\n\\n* Why is there no option on the UIDAI website to change the mobile number details?\\n\\n* Why is google.com tracking me on every other website? Like reddit, facebook? How to shoo it away, although blocking it using the privacy badger makes sites non-functional at times.\\n\\n* What is your advice you would like to give to your 20 year selves?\\n\\n* What precautions do you take regd. online mass surveillance which happens. How to fight it?\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: For Apar; How have you automated deletion of your tweets after a month and why? What are your views on data localisation, both with respect to the Indian Privacy Code, as well as the Justice Srikrishna Committee report?  Thanks for AMA, Here are my questions:\\n\\n1. Your bill defines personal data only to the extension of personal identification but what about the situations when a sample size is taken and it leads to identification but not the personal identification example google adds some are based on your data (shopping, browsing) and some are based on demographics (what indian people like, obsession with foreign brands). How we will be address that? \\n\\n2. As we already know, most of developing democracies have data protection law and authorities (though needs to be strengthen) but that don’t stop corporations from misusing it then how we will we able to stop them considering almost all the tech based are foreign funded and have big pockets. \\n\\n3. As in this internet age, if you are consuming something for free, then you yourself are the product – considering this, don’t you think convenience will always overshadow privacy barring few enlighten and rich souls?  \\n\\n4. As all this EULA’s, T&C are lengthy legal jargon and people just accepts them – where the real privacy stays and how explicit consent is derived in these situations as this is almost like you have to accept it otherwise there is no alternative (even the law like EU’s GDPR is not able to simplify it)\\n\\n5. Considering that the world is on the brink of fourth Industrial revolution and it will be fuelled by data, can we expect that in the upcoming time certain portion of personal data will defacto remain in public domain (name, DoB, banks account number, address etc) just like older days though now only certain clicks away. \\n\\n6. What about sting operations and mobile devices sending data for analytical purposes? \\n\\n7. Why can’t ne Aadhar number can be seen as indian replacement for Social Security number to avail basic services like phone number, bank accounts etc?\\n\\n8. What tools do you guys use for privacy protection? Which phone, phone OS, laptop, laptop OS, internet browser and addons? \\n\\n9. Why not Constitutional status for Privacy commission in your bill, considering it is going to be new norm in upcoming time just like election and election commission?\\n\\n10. No specific clause for Right to be forgotten in you bill which hits to the core of internet as they say you can\\'t really delete once something is on internet?\\n\\n Not a relevant comment on an AMA, but can someone do a tldr or explain in layman terms what the judgement is about? What is the stand of IFF regarding CryptoCurrency usage in India?  What are your thoughts on Aadhar? Tysm for doing this AMA..\\n\\nMany queries regarding current scenario, here are just a few\\n\\n\\\\->is the idea of \"finding the source of fake news\" feasible? It is like \"cut one head and 2 more shall take its place\" ...  how many will the govt. book!! too much too bring under control, shouldn\\'t there be some other way?\\n\\n\\\\->has the govt. or civil soc. made any plans on how to curb this menace in the coming election year? I bet Whatsapp will be massively used for propagation and hoaxes.\\n\\n\\\\->the current idea of making internet giants place a server in India to curb fake news.. OK no problem.. what if govt uses this to curb dissenting, criticising voices. what are the checks and balances in that case?\\n\\n\\\\->why can\\'t whatsapp have option of marking a \"particular msg\" as \"spam\". More the number of reports it gets on a particular msg, it can analyse and block its forwarding?\\n\\n\\\\->why cant user be asked for permission before he is added to any group?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-> your thoughts on the I&B Ministry team that monitors news channel for news on PM?'], ['Hey Reddit, I am Atamjeet S Bawa and I sold a T-90 Tank to the Indian Army!

Thanks for the AMA. \\n\\n1) How easy would it be for the average farmer to incorporate this technology into their existing systems, given the lack of technical expertise?\\n\\n2) Could you explain the process in a more rudimentary manner so that I'd be able to understand better too?\\n\\n\\n Great Initiative , but given that average farm land holding in India is very small how do a small farmer benefit from data ? What do you think of drones with high tech cameras and sensors that can do the same jobs as super expensive space satellites at much lesser cost. Drones aren't hindered by the clouds for visibility either.\\n\\nHow will satellites compete.   1. Can you please give us examples of certain metrics or data points you can share about farmers?\\n\\n2. Do you have any tie ups with Indian MFIs, NBFCs or Banks for this information?\\n\\n3. Are there companies outside Indian who share similar info with insurance and lending companies abroad? I'm interested in aerospace and been following the developments closely. I'm a fellow subscriber to r/isro and r/spacex. \\n\\n1) How do I apply to your company? I really am interested\\n\\n2) What advise would you give to a young guy in his 20's who's looking to start a company? Hello Prateep. Great initiative and amazing progress. I have few questions more on science part.\\n\\n1. I presume you monitor NDVI (and some other vegetation index) values form satellite data and trends as the crop grows to keep a check of its health. Do you use any improvement on these methods for the same? Has there been validation of the data through ground based measurements specifically for your work?\\n2. A follow up to what I asked in first point. Are there any plans to setup your own IoT based setup in the fields for further improvement of your methods.\\n3. How did you go about the funding at the initial stage of your startup? From where were you able to gain investments at that time? \\n4. Do you use opensource softwares (QGIS) for your work or paid ones? What do you think is the future and role of community guided open source technologies and softwares as means of improvement vs  usage of specific enterprise based softwares which can restrict the usage to certain specific users? Will things improve if we move towards sharing based technology progress?  Thanks for doing this, I have following two questions.   \\n1. Is there any lack of credit for farmers? All banks have mandatory priority sector lending and many MFIs also work in this sector, so demand must be met. Also why farmers demand to waive off credit. Is this justified ? OR just for political reasons govt does this?      \\n2. About Crop Insurance how much is the demand ? I feel insurance is bit complicated concept than Credit. Do farmers understand it fully? Also do you think Crop / other insurance can be very beneficial for improving financial status of farmers ? I don't see many Big Insurance companies doing it, means it's not very viable business?    Hey! Thanks for doing this! A few tangentially related q's: \\n\\n1)Do you plan(or even need) to set up your own hardware(in space)? With lots of smallsat launchers being introduced(RocketLab, Vega, now Isro's new LV), orbital access is slowly getting cheaper. \\n\\n2)Where do you think the Indian Space Program will be in <10 years time? Again, with the smaller launch companies offering lower costs, do you think customers will be drawn *away* from ISRO? Will ISRO be sustainable?\\n\\n3)What was ISRO like in terms of red-tape,  development speed, and general direction?\\n\\nThank you!  First) Dont you think it is a bit over the top for Indian farmers right now with big data and image processing. Yes it is help but the problems for Indian farmers are much different and much more basic. \\n\\nOne I can think of is access to water so that they dont have to be reliant on Rain Gods which was solved by western countries decades ago. \\n\\nSecond) My other question is since you are an entrepreneur can you say one can become a billionaire or even a millionaire ($ terms) in agri/poultry business in India? From what I believe as economy grows number of people who will consume meat & fruits (not just grains as is the case currently for the BPL population)  will increase as well as present meat & fruit consumers will consume much more. So I sense that there is a real opportunity here but I just cant put a finger on it.  >towards creating a positive impact on the lives of farmers by helping improve crop insurance, innovate on Agri lending services, and improve market linkages by creating intervention and decision intelligence frameworks for Agri value chain stakeholders.\\n\\nEh??

I’m thankful for the opportunity to be able to answer questions and am happy to keep the dialogue going.\\n\\n>>> [7:50pm IST] Thanks everyone for the engaging questions, appreciate the dialogue!  I hope that this has been useful to all of you.  Hearing your feedback is always useful to us and we take it seriously.  I'm impressed with the quality of questions and comments.  Thanks to the moderators as well for their help!\", 1451162259.0, 'AMA', 'Hello Mr Daniels, it\\'s good to have you here to answer our questions. In no particular order of importance:\\n\\n- Will Facebook remain ad-free forever on the Free Basics platform?\\n\\n- Will you allow all websites on the platform if they are compliant with the spec-sheet, even if you think they are non-essential to the target demographic of Free Basics, like religious or political propaganda websites?\\n\\n- Can you provide us complete assurance that you do absolutely no examination of web browsing patterns on the platform that are profitable for Facebook and/or its partners?\\n\\n- How do you feel about your India Free Basics partner Reliance advertising the platform as a way of [\"Accessing Facebook Without a data plan\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3xbhrt/wtf_just_saw_this_facebook_ad_in_todays_hindi/)? \\n\\n- This question is about how the Free Basics platform works. Facebook has said that [carriers bear the bandwidth costs of the Free Basics platform](https://info.internet.org/en/top-10-facts-about-free-basics/). In that case, aside from developing the platform, what exactly is Facebook doing here? Does Facebook bear any financial cost whatsoever? (aside from advertising)\\n\\n- Will the spec-sheet compliance appraisal be automated in the future? That is, will Facebook take steps to take itself out of the process of approving a website by completely making the process of checking whether an app or website complies with the spec sheet automatic? If not, why?\\n\\n- Will the Free Basics platform gradually evolve to bring the entire internet online? Something along the lines of [GoogleWebLight](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6211428?hl=en) seem appropriate for this.\\n\\n- Will the spec-sheet be gradually liberalized to include video as network infrastructure upgrades?\\n\\n- Free Basics added the spec-sheet approval process to move the platform closer to net neutrality. Were all your carrier partners internationally unconditionally fine with this change?\\n\\n- Has Free Basics faced similar legislative threats from other countries? How did you deal with those there? How many of the countries you operate in have any net neutrality guidelines at all?\\n\\n- How easy do you think it would be for an indie developer to make their apps or websites compliant with the Free Basics platform? How time-consuming is the process of optimizing a website or app for Free Basics?\\n\\n- Are you sending the messages from Facebook users to TRAI to advisorfea1@trai.gov.in? If so, why? The stock template for the comment in Facebook is not a response to the consultation paper, it\\'s an emotional appeal.\\n\\n- What do you think of the alternate proposal to have data limits instead of website/service limits? Is this an idea that you are against, or is it one that carriers oppose internationally? In either case, what are the reasons?\\n\\n- Is Facebook not asking Net Neutrality supporters on Facebook to send a message to TRAI in their favor? I didn\\'t get a single notification or prompt from Facebook about saving Free Basics, and neither did many supporters I know. And no notifications from my 600+ friends either. Is Facebook using profile data (including posts) to determine whether or not a user will be asked to save Free Basics?\\n\\n- I\\'m going to repeat a question from the TRAI consultation paper. Do you approve of differential pricing for apps and websites? Free Basics is a platform, so it\\'s not in the scope of this question. Currently in India, differential pricing for data is allowed in the form of [WhatsApp-only](http://www.airtel.in/whatsapp/?cid=social21491444) or [Facebook-only data plans](http://www.medianama.com/2014/06/223-bsnl-starts-offering-whatsapp-and-facebook-data-bundles/). Do you think this should be allowed?\\n\\n- Do you believe all carriers can afford to partner with you, and the bandwidth costs you entail?\\n\\n- Internet.org used to be have a few partnered sites selected by Facebook, and is now an open standard that anyone can join. Did this transformation happen in reaction to criticism by Net Neutrality activists in India?\\n\\n- How long does Free Basics normally take to evaluate a submitted site/service/app? Hi Chris!\\nI am testing a beta app for my university which can provide VoIP services on slow networks. My aim is to make it nation-wide service capable of working on 2G speeds (rate = 256kbps). However As per Guidelines of Free Basics, VoIP services are not welcome. Why can I not publish an app/ website on free basics in spite of it being a light-loaded service?  Assuming everything about Free Basics is true as claimed by Facebook, why should India draft a policy looking at just one case of benevolent Zero Rating, while it\\'s abundantly clear that most cases of Zero Rating are malicious? You can\\'t let an individual case dictate policy. 1. What was the rationale for renaming internet.org to free basics? The change in technical specs didn\\'t require a name change. Wasn\\'t that just a PR exercise which coincided with heavy ad spending to mislead even critics into thinking this is something completely different?\\n2. You released a survey that said 9 out of 10 net neutrality supporters support free basics. Can you clarify what was the sample you took for this survey?\\n3. Facebook keeps saying it won\\'t earn any profit from free basics. Won\\'t a potential new user base going into the millions who start off thinking Facebook is a \\'free basic\\' feature of the internet count as a source of potential profits?\\n4. If Facebook does not intend to profit from free basics directly or indirectly, how will you justify all the money spent on promoting it to your shareholders when they ask you why you keep spending money on a scheme that faces so much opposition?\\n\\nEdit: Removed an analogy which wasn\\'t widely known These are questions the members of Free Software Movement Karnataka have. \\n\\n1. If Free Basics allows access to only certain parts of the internet, how exactly does Facebook claim that it is in support of net neutrality? This very act of passive monopoly is quite the opposite of what the advocates of net neutrality believe.\\n\\n1. What percentage of all web based services do they honestly see to be a part of Free Basics in about a year or so?\\n\\n1. Facebook seems to claim that Free Basics is a charitable contribution to society, but activists have been opposing it for a long time and Facebook is actively fighting back. Why is Facebook spending so much money and effort on campaigning for something that people clearly do not want? If people don\\'t want your \"charity\", why force it upon them? And what does that say about the true nature of Free Basics?\\n\\n1. If providing connectivity is the goal of Free Basics, why is Facebook in control? Why not provide full Internet access instead (perhaps limited in speed and data usage)? Can Facebook explain why it needs to control (and potentially censor and spy on) users\\' Internet access for reasons other than its own financial gain?\\n\\n1. It appears that Free Basics is a consumer connection which does not support creation of digital produce. How does FB feel about forcing people to become consumers?\\n\\n1. How much has Facebook spent on advertisements and lobbying for Free Basics?\\n\\n1. As an educationist I want my students to become creators rather than consumers as this will help the growth of the nation. Why is FB intent on forcing a technically substandard solution?\\n\\n1. When you showed people a notification, asking them to support Free Basics, there wasn\\'t a chance for the other side of the argument (activists, net neutrality etc.) to be heard, and hence the support provided by your users was just after hearing one side. Then how can you count that as unprecedented support? Aircel too is giving [\\'Free Basic Internet\\'](http://trak.in/tags/business/2015/10/16/aircel-free-basic-internet-net-neutral-free-fair-facebook/), which lets new users on their connection to access the internet under limited bandwidth(for all sites), but not limited websites. So Aircel is letting new users use \\'free\\' internet as they wish, they can surf whatsoever website  they desire unlike \\'Facebook\\'s \\'free basic\\' that only let\\'s a handful websites to be used under Facebook\\'s discrimination.\\n\\nIf Facebook really wants people who\\'ve never been on the internet before to show how it\\'s like, why doesn\\'t Facebook give them *free data* to surf whatsoever website they desire?  Why is Facebook causing a monopoly in their favor by letting only a handful websites be used by the user for free? This is an *evident* breach of Net-Neutrality, and saying that new start-ups can apply to be in Facebook\\'s \\'walled garden\\' doesn\\'t change the fact that Facebook can play the role of \\'Big Brother\\' and decide who gets on their Free Basics and who doesn’t. Doing this, Facebook and it\\'s sisters sites on \\'Free Basics\\' already have an unfair advantage. \\n\\nFacebook stood up **for** Net Neutrality in the U.S to the proposed \\'fast lane and slow lane\\' . But openly violates it in over 33 countries and claims that this is different? Why and how is this different ? The only difference I see is that Facebook instead of trying to control speed like that of Comcast and AT&T(because Facebook isn\\'t an ISP) is engaged in trying to control content.\\n\\nControlling Content, is a fundamental breach of Net Neutrality. \\n\\n\\n        \\n Dear Mr. Daniels, I had posted my questions [in the earlier thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3y3h1o/ama_announcement_chris_daniels_vice_president/cyabzsp) to give you and your team some time to procure the numbers.\\n\\n\\n*Question 1:* **How much money has been put into marketing your internet.org platform?** In-app notifications, polls, windows and sponsored FB posts count as marketing. More specifically, how much would it have cost a third party to advertise on the scale of \"free basics\" on Facebook? **How much of it was dedicated to the actual product development?** If Facebook stands to make no profit from this venture, why has the company made the said investment in marketing and development?\\n\\n\\n*Question 2:* If (big if) the motive was 100% charity, **what other ways were considered as worthy of charity?** Example: Microsoft\\'s former CEO launched the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to deal with issues in the developing world. Why would Zuck and other stakeholders not just do the same? Do you really think a farmer in Maharashtra can benefit more from joining Facebook groups than having access to high-yielding crop, equipment, and infrastructure?\\n\\n\\n*Question 3:* **What are your plans for making sure that the next billion internet users don\\'t fall prey to the same mistakes that the first billion did?** Are there landing pages dedicated to educating them against common internet frauds and time-wasters? What\\'s to say that they won\\'t just end up sending a bunch of frandsheep requests to women and killing each other over online arguments? We both know that\\'s happened many times in the past, and the fact that you\\'re planning to introduce a largely un-initiated audience to this platform greatly increases such risks. **By how much has Facebook beefed up its moderation team to deal with foreseeable cases of severe online harassment?**\\n\\n*Question 4:* Please take a few minutes to [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAQWsTFF0BM) and r**espond to concerns raised therein**. Looking forward to your side of the story on why VOIP was omitted. Please feel free to respond to other critical points mentioned in that video too.\\n\\n*Feedback:* Your marketing for internet.org has been atrocious. Calling people who do not subscribe to your world view \\'lobbyists\\' is akin to vilifying everyone who disagrees with you. That\\'s how children argue! The whole over-aggressive, dare I say immature, marketing push has raised more eyebrows than eyeballs.\\n\\nI appreciate your attention. Please take the time to do an AMA for more than an hour. This is a complicated and critical conversation, arbitrary limitations on communication will harm both our POVs. After all, having more and better communication is the point of the Internet (.org or otherwise).\\n\\nI look forward to an extended, insightful conversation with you and the Reddit India community. These questions were raised with inputs from reddit users on the comment thread linked above.\\n\\nThanks again!\\n\\nEdit: Grammar. In the recent past, you have blocked Telegram links on Whatsapp, a strange move. You have also done similar things in the past, banning competitors . Early today, ~~Facebook was warning people when they clicked on a SaveTheInternet link~~ (as /u/sainibhai points out, this is wrong). In fact, instead of educating people about your offering, you were trying to take advantage of people who want a digital India by getting them to send an e-mail, or say yes to a prompt, without even understanding what they were getting into.\\n\\nThere’s a clear precedent in your actions here. You’re a private business and you are going to uphold your own interests, which is fair. So, questions:\\n\\na) Why should you be the gatekeeper of the Internet for a huge percentage of Indians when you clearly have a poor history dealing with any kind of resistance?\\n\\nb) How is it digital “equality” when people are getting access to the a very, very tiny set of websites? They aren’t being connected to the marvel that is the Internet: they are getting access to a company — and a few others, who get approved by that company — that’s trying to find new ways to onboard users onto their platform and strengthen their hold on the market which, in itself, is very fair except for the misleading ads you’re putting up.\\n\\nc) If your data says that 50% of the people who get Free Basics start paying for their data within 30 days, there surely has to be a much better way to advertise the Internet and its potential benefits to them, since that’s all they are lacking at the moment? Could the telecom operators not set up a 30 day free trial to all of the Internet after which those 50% would still start paying for their data unless there’s something off there?\\n\\nI’m as eager for a digital India as anybody, but India can chart its own way, even if it’s slow in your view. We got a mobile phone in hands of pretty much every Indian within a decade. Internet will reach every Indian household too, and by the Internet, I mean the real Internet, where everyone has access to the same content — digital “equality” — without a private business gatekeeping. You have partnered with RCom to deliver FreeBasics in India.\\n\\nBUT all I see Rcom advertising only about the benefit of using Free Facebbok on their platform, no mention of other services. Don\\'t you think the ulterior effects of FreeBasics is already becoming apparent.\\n\\nAlso, why Rcom, which has the one of the worst coverage inrural areas?\\n\\nFacebook is running a huge campaign on its platform. How much this would have cost if some other user would like to run such a campaign on Facebook? I appreciate the fact that you are doing this AMA session. \\n\\n-----\\n\\nMy question to you is the following: \\n\\nThere are quite a few options for providing free-of-cost internet access such as those provided by companies like [Gigato](http://www.digit.in/general/gigatos-toll-free-internet-28094.html), [Jana.com](http://www.thehindu.com/business/jana-is-in-full-support-of-net-neutrality/article7181486.ece) and [Mozilla](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/net-neutrality-mozilla-suggests-equal-rating/article7177532.ece). They basically earn advertising revenue and in exchange for viewing ads/apps/sponsored products users get access to the ENTIRE internet, and these plans are neutral towards all websites/apps/services on the internet. \\n\\nWhy can\\'t Facebook adopt a similar net neutral model for providing internet access? What is so special about Free Basics that Gigato, Jana and Mozilla models don\\'t have?\\n\\n-----\\n\\nSome more Net Neutral alternatives on this page: https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l9y7t/net_neutrality_supporters_are_not_depriving_the/\\n\\n-----\\n\\nAnd a request to your team, kindly don\\'t paint Net Neutrality supporters as anti-poor. It is a disingenuous attempt at deflecting the actual argument of importance of Net Neutrality.'], [\"Hey r/India!

I have many questions:  \\n  \\n- Why does every pilot try to talk like Chuck Yeager?   \\n- What do pilots do after a certain point? Do they just keep flying into their late 50s and then retire? Or do they quit and become pilots for millionaires and multimillionaires?  \\n- What aircraft type do you prefer to fly?  \\n- What is your least favorite airport and airroute?  \\n- What percentage of the flight are you actually on the controls?  \\n- What kind of spooky shit do you see while flying that passengers can\\'t, and are you prevented from talking about it?  \\n- Do pilots get access to cool parts of the airport that us civvies don\\'t?  Honest answer please, do you know what ALL the buttons do? About a decade back, I used to fly a lot domestically(passenger of course) in the South through Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Louisville - the one thing that struck me about the crew in the south was that while they greet nearly all whites they tended to lose eye contact or lower their voice when this brown man(me) boarded. Of course I would look up from my book and say an extra-loud \"GOOD EVENING\" as I walked into the plane :)\\n\\nIt was a different experience around West Coast as the flight attendants were gregarious and fun. Do you still have a lot of racially stuck-up attendants in the South?\\n\\nIt was more on domestic airlines. The Mumbai-Atlanta Delta Flight for example typically had friendly attendants, perhaps they thought only the richer Indians travel internationally. But Atlanta-Cincinnati? Every attendant had her Snootypant on. This is one of the best AMA thread in recent times, very informative. I would like to say I envy your job and thank you very much for doing this AMA Haven\\'t ever seen an AMA with iceman\\'s enthusiasm and thoroughness. Thank you! Please rate the domestic airlines in India as per your judgements with regards to their safety and performance. Always wanted to be a pilot, glad to see your AMA.\\n\\nCouple of questions:\\n\\n1. Irrespective of the flying hours you have, do you still get nervous  or feel an adrenaline rush when approaching under heavy turbulence? I recall a JAI flight, in a 77W, to EBBR under heavy turbulence all the way from descent to wheels down and even the most seasoned travelers in the cabin seemed to be very perturbed. \\n\\n2. Do you fly as a hobby ever? Soaring or gliding? \\n\\n3. Any opinions on Sully (the movie)? I ask because I feel like the incident is easily glorified-- as respectable as Captain Sully\\'s and the crew\\'s actions were, I think that the situation is exactly what the training is for and focusing on one act of brilliant competence doesn\\'t do justice to the professionalism and competence of the thousands of pilots and cabin crew who take care of us everyday. \\n\\n4. This is more of a very selfish comment and not really a question. One thing I really hate about the a*holes who hijacked the planes on 9/11 is that it forever changed cockpit entry regulations and I don\\'t think I will ever get to see the cockpit at FL400. Unless I charter my own Learjet, but that\\'s going to have to wait for a bit. I hope you enjoy the views you get to see from the best office in the world. \\n\\nIf you\\'re ever in YYZ, I\\'d buy you a beer or Roohafza if I can hear more stories.

It is commonly called a decentralized digital currency. It was invented in 2009. It is an open source software. This means, that no person, company or country owns this network just like no one owns the Internet. The system is peer-to-peer, that is, users can transact directly without an intermediary like a bank, a credit card company or a clearing house. Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. \\n\\nShort explanation on what is bitcoin: https://youtu.be/jiEllBFNaMA\\n\\nA longer version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmU28mgihB4\\n\\n**About Zebpay & Sandeep Goenka**\\n\\nZebpay is a bitcoin app available for Android and iPhones. It is the most popular bitcoin exchange in India. Users can buy / sell bitcoins, top up airtime and buy vouchers of Flipkart, Amazon and more. Zebpay is the first in the industry to launch bitcoin wallet app that enables bitcoin transactions using a mobile number without any complexities to understand bitcoin addresses, taking backups or fear of losing bitcoins. \\n\\nIn just a year, Zebpay app has clocked 150,000 downloads and crossed a turnover of Rs 450 crores. After early adopters, bitcoins are attracting a new class of users like young professionals and HNIs. Users are now using bitcoin as an alternative investment. They are also using it for online shopping, airtime top up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers. We believe India will see an explosion of digital assets like bitcoins in next 2 years.

My questions below:\\n\\n* How satisfied are scientists at all levels in ISRO ? Do they all get to work with exciting stuff and how much internal politics goes on?\\n* Why is the online published coverage/photos/webcasts for ISRO missions so bad? For example: For the moon mission, there are were no photos for months, no live videos. Not much better for the Mars missions. There is hardly any data for stuff which should be easily possible, NASA has much richer feeds. Why is this ? Govt censor/security/red tape ?\\n* What operating systems/software do these missions use? Control software/onboard/desktop OS etc ?\\n Hello rocket scientists!!\\n\\nWhat nations approach ISRO to launch their satellites ?\\n\\nWhat happens to load inside the rocket if the mission fails? Is there anyway those expensive satellites are saved ?\\n\\n And the most important question.\\n\\nKitna deti hai? What kind of qualification would I require to work at ISRO?

The US and the West intentionally kept China out citing security concerns. Why was India not involved and whats the probability India will get invoved now given that the ISS will only be up till 2020.  \\n\\n\\n* Few years back the US passed a Law which bars foreign nationals (students and Scientists from entering certain NASA enclosures) \\n\\n Has this(if at all) affected ISRO and the Indian Space development. \\n\\n* Whats the timeline on a Space Lab/Station for India (Chinese have set its date at 2020, just as ISS is dismantled and the Russian modules of ISS make up a new Station for Russians themselves)  \\n\\n\\n* ISRO mission to Venus in 2015. Whats new about it, what is going to be tested and surveyed.  \\n\\n* How are GAGAN and IRNSS different, this seems to be confusing me.  \\n\\n* Why is IRNSS only limited to the Indian subcontinent Only, Why isn't it Global like the new Chinese BeiDou-2 system. Surely the sale of service like GPS does and BeiDou-2 and EU's Galileo will provide is enough incentive plus much more. \\n\\n* Since its been mentioned that all ground hardware and receivers will be India made how will this be integrated into Mobile and such devices since such chips are manufactured at few places(near assembly plants).  \\nHow long before we can use it in our phones? \\n\\n* How will the accuracy be, is using a geostationary orbit for GPS system efficient(i've read that such satellites provide limited coverage to only where the satellites are visible)  \\n\\n\\nLastly, all the best and keep doing your great work.

I read your [insightful article](http://tathagatasatpathy.com/web/Epidemic.aspx) about the spread of Jaundice in Orissa. There has been much research that uses mobile phone cameras to detect Jaundice, and many apps for doing this have been developed in western countries (predominantly for detecting Jaundice in infants). Some of us would like to work with the health ministry to develop these for India. How can we reach out to them?\\n1. Do you think that the short-term social ills that can arise from deregulation (like agitation among farmers and tribals) are worth it for the potential long-term benefits? To this end, what are your views on the Land Acquisition Bill?\\n1. The GDP of Mumbai is more than the GDP of the entire state of Orissa. Orissa has much untapped economic potential (tourism, food processing and manufacturing). Yet, governments in the state have not focused on significant pro-growth reforms - regardless of political affiliation. Why do you think that is the case?\\n\\nAgain, thank you very much for doing this AMA. I hope your example is followed by more legislators in the country. Hi, I am from your constituency. I live in Caltex square area. \\n\\nI wanted to ask that [last year the government announced a special job fair](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Students-in-a-fix-over-deferred-dates-for-job-fair-many-cancel-reservations/articleshow/42330062.cms) for unemployed technical and management graduates. 100 INR was collected from each interested student.

Better or worse in terms of efficiency of getting bills passed, the general behavior and attitude?

So here are my questions:-\\n\\nQ1 Last November you spoke about Black Money and said \"Governance and Government do not change according to the political party\" Is this also applicable to your party i.e. BJD which is in the Government in Odisha?\\n\\nQ2 In 2014 General Elections Narendra Modi\\'s juggernaut swept almost the entire country but not Odisha. Their BJD won 20 out of 21 LS seats. How did your party manage that? \\n\\nQ3. When you were speaking on Land Acquisition act you said \" Nation wants to know\". A MP behind you was quick to point out the journalist with whom this phrase is associated. How often does such funny incidents happen in the house?\\n\\nQ4 What will be your advice for young people like me who want to come into politics? \\n\\nQ5 and last question When are we going to see a BJP-BJD alliance again? :P >So go ahead and Ask Me Anything!

And what have you done for the rest? (Please provide sources if u can)\\n\\n----\\n\\n**2)** In India atleast, LS RS proceedings tend to be a noisy situation where many politicians engage in hooliganism. Most practically scream at the top of their lungs, disregarding everything anybody has to say. There are many other incidences that just sounds pathetic. IMO (In my opinion) and I\\'m pretty sure many agree with me on this, It feels pretty sad to see something like this happening. I assume its supposed to show that the politicians are fighting hard for the people they represent, but to many (even if they support our own beliefs) it just looks like the politicians are shutting down every other other views. LS and RS are places where each of the points are supposed to be thoroughly vetted and debated. Screaming helps no one (IMO). Similar to parties walking out. I know its part of tactics where a certain group wants show protest, but not want to disturb political deals. Why can\\'t they have a separate flag that just say they should not be counted while still listening to all sides of the story and participating in the debate instead of walking out on every thing? **What are your views about this?**\\n\\n----\\n\\n**3)** What are the challenges that you have faced (not political parties) that have impeded you in your efforts?\\n\\n----\\n\\n**4)** If you could create a law that would be implemented (that isn\\'t already), what would that be?\\n\\n----\\n\\n**5)** How long do you think will it take for debates raging online to have a VERY sizeable impact in real life politics.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**6)** What are your views on the bad Maoist situation in Orissa? Do you feel sections of the proper Indian Military (not CRPF), and Air force needs to be brought in to deal with the Maoist problems?\\n\\n----\\n\\n**7)** How would you rate the practices taken by the Orissa government to boost Industries and Industrial growth?\\n\\n----\\n\\n**8)** Who do you think acts like an Idiot the most in the LS (in terms of impeding the processes of the LS)\\n\\n----\\n\\n**9)** How do you think that being the editor of your own newspaper has helped you in your personal and political endeavours.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**10)** Call out some of the bad practices of BJD, or acts that you don\\'t like/support.\\n\\n----\\n**11)** Personal question: I\\'ve identified myself as a gamer (computer gamer) when i was younger. I still do (but not professionally now due to familial pressure). We see tournaments such as the DOTA2 international which gives out prize money of about (67 crores ->in comparison IPL prize pool was about 25 crores), and many other such for a large number of games. The chances of earning good amounts of money in playing computer & console games on a competitive level is far higher than in most other sports, with a very large audience. And even in case we can\\'t make it to the big league, streaming pays a lot of money. Yet everyone from the government at best does not do much to stop them and at worst erects barrier after barrier to stop people from playing. This is in addition to the bad rep that gaming already has. Many other countries have started organizations to help its citizens in their ordeals - (Especially in terms of procurement of visa etc) Korea, malaysia, China, Canada, America (in the process of creating one). Why hasn\\'t our government even recognized it as a sport?\\n\\n----\\n\\n**12)** India is considered as one of the most trigger happy countries in terms of censorship. What are your opinions about that and also in terms of privacy concerns being raised.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**13)** How much do you think India is able to handle the American NSA and other such organizations that want to snoop on our (confidential government data + normal everyday data of its citizens) by their projects like PRISM etc.?\\n\\n----\\n\\n**14)** What is the question that you assumed  you\\'d most probably have to face, right before doing this? \\n\\n----\\n\\n**15)**lastly what are your views about memes on the internet and on portals like whatsapp including ones that are probably based on you?\\n\\n----\\n\\n***Please answer what you can.

Only then you get your ID card back. \\n\\nDuring the first week of my 1st year in college i was stopped at the college gate for wearing a formal shirt which had white collar and white handcuffs.

So they didn’t have much to blame me for except for my marks during counseling.\\n\\nDuring my counseling , I was humiliated. Chairman pulled my hair and asked me to do 20 sit-ups. Asked me to pay the sum of Rs.30,000 if i didnt do situps,which the management paid for my trips for research conferences abroad though my entire expense was more than 1 lakh.Just did what he said, coz my dad couldn\\'t afford to pay it back because of our financial situation back then. He laughed when I said im not attending placements since I was starting a company. He asked me to attend placements and see if I could get a job first. I cried like a baby in front of my dad, chairman and HOD. Never felt so humiliated in my life ever before. None of my batch mates knew what happened during counseling. Didn’t go to college for next 2 days.I did not attend convocation along with my batchmates since I hadn\\'t finished my exams and took a break from college. I didn’t want to graduate from this college. Some Professors told me I was fit for herding cows and nothing else.\\n\\nIts sad to hear that these rules still exist and students have to go through 4 years of hell! I am raging so hard right now. I can\\'t imagine someone ruining 4 years of my life like that. I will hold a grudge for my entire life. WTF. I also did my bachelors at Sai Ram Engineering College. It has been four years since I graduated and the fact that rules have gotten worse is disappointing but not surprising. But I must admit that I did not care much about the rules because of my introvert nature. I probably would not have socialized much even if such rules were not in place. Still, I hated the college (and similar colleges in Chennai) because of the quality of teaching and the way teachers were handled by the administration. \\n\\nIn the department I studied, there are only one or two teachers that I would consider as good. The fact that some of the teachers were alumni of the same college made things worse. The problem lies with the administration which is ignoring the need for quality teachers and focusing silly rules instead. It is a pathetic state. \\n\\nI feel sorry for the good teachers in such colleges. They are restricted, over-burdened and forget about recognition - they mostly don\\'t get the respect they deserve from the management. It is sickening. \\n\\nTo people who say that students are not protesting against the rules, that is not entirely true. During my final year, there was even a strike/protest (whatever) conducted by some students. (Once again, I admit, being the person I am, I did not participate but quietly observed). The demand was to sack the chief of the floor supervisors. Nothing happened in the end, as far as I know. The protests were quickly snuffed out. The instigators were, er.. subdued. Parents were called. Suspension were dished out. Everything back to \"normal\".\\n\\nI honestly don\\'t know how change can be brought about. It is not as simple as students and parents losing interest in engineering because, the owners of such colleges run several institutions across several streams (engineering, dental, medical, sairam group even has a siddha college). One hope is that a new generation of private institution owners would bring about some change. But that is a faint hope. Recently, the chairman of sai ram institutions passed away. Now, his son runs the college, I think. But there seems to be no change here.   controversial opinion:\\n\\nas a person from WB, burn down the building, beat up the management, gherao them for a day or three.

However, several Pvt. sector companies are of the opinion that as long as DPSUs exist major defense contracts will always be awarded to the DPSU.\\n\\nIn your experience what should the Govt of India do to ensure a level playing field for both DPSUs & Pvt. Indian companies?\\n\\nMany Thanks,\\nDebajit Damn, 26 years in the army and 15 as a journalist!? Surprised! It feels like I\\'ve been seeing you cover war zones forever! Thanks for being here. I have 2 questions. \\n\\n__________\\nI remember you reported events for Indian news channels from Afghanistan during the post 9/11 US intervention there.  So a question from that region. \\n\\nWhy isn\\'t India building Active Military Bases there since we have one in some capacity in Tajikistan of all places.  \\nThere can\\'t be a reason that it will antagonize *Someone* because they are already antagonized regardless. So whats the delay. \\n\\n______\\n\\nAnd Why can\\'t India instead of whining/worried about CPEC actually counter-compete with CPEC in economic terms by extending its Himachal-Ladakh sector Alternative Supply route that India is currently building/planning(to limit its reliance on the high risk Valley route) and extend it into Central Asia and Russia.   \\n\\nEast of Pamirs instead of West as has been the dream since Independence.  \\nLink this with a Delhi-Mumbai Corridor and a port in Gujarat-Maharashtra.  \\nAll of these are already getting build anyway by India so it can\\'t really be argued its too expensive, so why not extent it just a bit?  \\n\\nChina wouldn\\'t really have many qualms(after some convincing) since its always about money with them primarily, plus this will get linked with their Belt Section of OBOR (its not like India isn\\'t part of it anyway, there is the BCIM already so India is already tapped in, plus the AIIB/NDB funding)so they have that incentive plus greater energy security for them (their primary reason for CPEC in Pakistan to begin with) and also them feeling less leveraged by Pakistan bilaterally (all these are factors which will be attractive to China, strategically in the long term) and given that /Central Asian/SCO members will more than welcome the massive market right on their door steps, i.e. North India.    \\n\\nWhat is wrong with this? \\n\\nI hope you don\\'t mind the long winded question/suggestion.  \\n\\nThanks. \\n Hi Ajai, it\\'s Tejpal :)\\n\\n1) How likely do you feel a Rafale Make In India is? A BJP spokesperson has mentioned it and there is most definitely a need for it + the Indian Navy are looking to purchase it for their INS Vishal too, no? It makes sense to shift a production line to India and produce it in far larger numbers.\\n\\n2) Leading me on to this question, by 2030, there will be 210+ Jaguars/MiG-29UPGs/Mirage-2000s that will need replacing or near retiring + there are 100+ MiG-27s that need retiring imminently. The replacement for the near 250 MiG-21s whilst increasing squadron strength are the Tejas Mk1/Mk1A and either the Gripen-E/F-16 Block 70 but where is the medium jet going to come from? \\n\\nThe Rafale with MII?\\n\\n3) Do you have any info on the AMCA? With ToT being guaranteed by Dassault/Thales et al and French involvement with Kaveri, surely the jet will be set back in order to accommodate for these improvements? \\n\\n4) Finally, with the Tejas, do you feel that the IN N-LCA orders and the current 120 Mk1/Mk1A orders will be just that for the jet or do you feel there is potential orders within the IAF/IN and export?\\n\\nThank you so much! Was it a right move for government to go public on surgical strike in POK? Would request you reply to Bernard_Wooley\\'s questions. Also, would like your take on the Excalibur.\\nIn general though - do you support India opting for indigenous products instead of foreign ones, at cost of some operational capability? Is the threat of various killswitches/spare-part supply denials a real one when it comes to foreign influence on India\\'s military capabilities? Hello\\n\\nI hope you don\\'t mind my asking, but some of the questions have been about your journalistic experience, and this is something I\\'ve always wondered about:\\n\\n1.

For those who have been following the journey from the beginning, it might come as a surprise that i have been by myself and not accompanied by a documentary crew as was the case when i started (refer to previous AmA). Restricted by personal reasons and security concerns, the crew decided to drop out after they had covered the stretch in West Bengal. Though this affected the design of the project as envisioned and also induced a fair bit of mental agony, it helped me re-emphasize my belief that the only limitations are the ones that we put on ourselves.\\n\\nWhat this has done though, is that it helped me survive longer on the road with the same amount of funds we were able to raise in the first round of crowdfunding. We'll soon be going live with a second round of crowdfunding, since the first round didn’t reach our target and use that to support the Moving Upstream series of projects, which is soon going to witness an expansion.

We are a very long way away from having clean air in Delhi, most parts of North India, and around the world. Air pollution in cities across the country even the likes of Bombay and Madras are unhealthy (just not as bad as Delhi).\\n\\n\\nShocking Facts About Air Pollution:\\n\\n1. 92% of the people in the world  don't have access to clean air.\\n\\n2. 6.5 million people die prematurely every year because of air pollution. That's more than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and traffic accidents combined.\\n\\n3. Scientists don't yet know the precise extent of health affects of sustained exposure to very unhealthy and hazardous air quality levels, because most air quality research thus far has been done in countries with relatively much much cleaner air than India.\\n\\n\\nThere is no reason why air pollution data shouldn’t be as easy to access and understand as weather data. I’m working to make that happen for worldwide air quality data at http://www.AirAirAir.org.\\n\\nI built Smokey - It's a friendly air pollution chatbot that works in Facebook Messenger. It is the easiest way to monitor the air quality levels in your city every day, and learn what you can do about it to protect yourself. You can search for “smokey air” in Facebook Messenger app, or just click on http://m.me/smokeybot. It's totally free and works like magic for cities around the world in 33 countries.\\n\\n\\nPrior to this, I launched a simple twitter bot, [DelhivsWorld](http://www.twitter.com/delhivsworld) - it tweets out hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels compared to Beijing, London, New  York and Sydney.\\n\\n\\nI definitely don’t have all the answers, but I want to hear your experiences about air pollution and help in any way I can, especially by democratizing air pollution data in a way that's super easy to access and understand for absolutely everyone with an internet connection.\\n\\n\\n**Let’s talk air pollution.**\\n\\nI have a simple question for you: Do you know the air quality in your city today?

How much role does dust play.\\n\\n2. I have noticed that across all Indian states in cities and towns the dust factor is very high, I have never been out of India but people who have say that other countries are not so dusty.
